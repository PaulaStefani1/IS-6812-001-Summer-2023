  We now have three of these devices in our home to help save on our cable bill. We use them for the spectrum app and they work great! Very easy to set up. A word to the wise - I read a couple of reviews about an activation fee. I set two of these up today and there is no activation fee!! If you are being asked to pay a fee you are in the wrong place!  Do not google the set up website - type in the address as it is when prompted on the screen and you will be fine.

  I finally decided to buy one to help keep my TV relevant. Most of the apps from my 2011 model TV don't work anymore and was limited in functionality. I wish I bought one of these years ago though. Now, reading through previous comments, there is someone who gave 2 stars and complained about being single banded WiFi. This guy doesn't pay attention to what hes looking at. Yes, this is clearly stated that it only uses 2.4GHz band. No, they didn't go backwards in any form with this. With a quick search, and all Roku Expresses, which is what this is, have been single band. And 2.4GHz is fine when only going 1080p for HD.Now about using it. Setting everything up doesn't take long, around 10-15 minutes. Once you have it set up, it's eay to use to get on Netflix, or Amazon Prime to watch your favorite shows. You can also download some other apps to get some free TV to you flip through another couple hundred channels and complain about there is nothing to watch, because we all know we do that. When watching something, the picture does take a minute to download, buffer, and catch up, so the first little bit may be a bit blurry, but it evens out. There is also the Roku app for your phone, and this adds some ease of use. Instead of using the remote to attempt to hit the sensor on the device, you can connect to the Roku on your phone as long as they are on the same WiFi network.If you want to stream easier on your TV, or your TV doesn't have the Smart features you want, I would recommend this. If you want 4K video, then you need to look at something else because this doesn't off it. Also, if you really need to use 5GHz WiFi, then also, look elsewhere. Now, I can't compare this to other models, but this works well for what I wanted it for. Would recommend.

  I had to return it today though I only had it for 1 day or so. Reason: There's activation fee of $100, which was not specified on the webpage when I made the purchase. Based on the description on the webpage, I was under the impression that I just have to pay for the device & get all the free channels I want. It described that I only have to pay for the channels that were not free. However, when I finally got a chance to install the device on my TV & tried to activate it using the code on the TV screen, it told me that it failed. I called the support phone# & was told by someone with heavy accent who rudely rambled on & on about all kinds of benefits of activating the device WITHOUT giving me a chance to talk. After he was done advertising for his company's product, he finally said it would cost me $100 to create an account in order to activate it. He told me also before I hung up the phone that if I decide to pay to create an account, I'd have to call Monday (it was Saturday when I called). This might have been a good product, but the company should've made buyers aware upfront of the activation fee. In all, I was totally disappointed.

  Overall, was I eventually moderately satisfied. The initial setup was a breeze. However, I got a rude shock when the video from a lot of channels wouldn't stream - instead of video, I got only sound and error code 020. (Of note, I was trying to run our Roku through an HDMI signal switch.)As it turns out, a lot of HDMI signal switches/splitters sold on Amazon are NOT HDCP compatible. (HDCP is a form of digital copy protection; I only learned about this when trying to troubleshoot this Roku). A lot of channels available on the Roku use HDCP. So, as a result, content from those channels could not be streamed from the Roku to our TV through our HDMI switch/splitter. It took some Googling to figure this out - the Roku support article regarding HDCP error messages mostly discussed unplugging and replugging things, and turning things on and off again. It did not mention HDMI signal switch/splitter incompatibility. I would have been up and running more quickly, and ultimately more satisfied, if that had been the case.After figuring this out, I plugged the Roku directly into the TV, and it worked perfectly. Unfortunately, I had to rearrange all of our other HDMI inputs in order to do this.If you are reliant on HDMI switches/splitters, figure out if your switch is HDCP compatible before getting this incarnation of Roku.Also, it is advertised that the Roku mobile app has a keyboard function - on my iOS, the the mobile remote control functions that I've tried work, with the exception of the mobile keyboard. Hopefully a Google search will yield a fix, but I would be even more satisfied if this keyboard feature worked right out of the box.EDIT:The remote control stopped working after a month. It's a good thing there is a mobile Roku app. Otherwise, we'd have to order a new remote.

  I bought this Roku to expand into a fourth room, and I was happy to see that it was offered at a fraction of the cost of my other Roku models. Of course, this bare-boned unit asks for you to sacrifice some of the options on the more expensive units, such as a TV on/off button, volume control, and an earphone plug-in on the remote. All of these minor issues are easily solved by using both the Roku and the TV remotes or by employing the free Roku mobile app for iOS or Android.A major issue for some consumers might be the 2.4 GHz wireless connection. After several days of use, we have seen no issues. Streaming has been perfect, no lagging or interruptions, and load time seems no longer than any of the other Roku units we own.Installation was easy and there should be no hiccups for the majority of users. This was the first time that Roku asked me to sign up with a Google account, so it took the extra few minutes for me to set that up, but otherwise it was no harder than usual.If you are looking for a solid unit and a great price, you can't do better than this unit. Five stars.

  Why have they gone backwards from a few years ago and are producing new devices (this is not the first so be  careful) that support only the oldest 2.4 ghz wireless band.  They talk about high speed streaming needing a strong wifi network and internet connection but limit you to the slowest option on your modern router.  My Roku 2 second gen devices from 4 years ago do only support wireless N but they do so on both the 2.4 and 5.0 wireless bands.  This makes a big speed difference on any network but if you happen to live in a populated area it makes a HUGE difference.

  I just bought this product and when I attempted to activate it it came up as an error and informed me to call an 866 number from a company named IDA to activate my Roku. I was informed that there was a one time activation fee of $69.99.  I informed him that nothing on Amazon stated that there are activation fees and I refused to pay it.  This 866 number popped up on my screen during the activation process appearing to be legit. He told me this was an independent company working for Roku. I said BS and hung up. I then contacted Roku's website directly and activated without any further problems.  Please be careful and do not fall for their nonsense. It even states on Roku's screen that they will never charge for activation or updates.  Amazon should look into this since it will create a lot of ill will towards Amazon. If the 866 number comes up during activation do not call. Go to Roku's website and enter code and it will be activated at no charge.

  Installing this new 2019 version of the Roku streaming ""box,"" it messed up my TV, my cable and my head.  There was no telephone or online support for the problems I was contending with, only a disembodied voice when I called that said there were videos available online.  I looked at them but they did not help.  Fortunately, my friendly local cable company came to the rescue and explained how the system could work, making it a very pesky operation.Had I known there was no support, I would not have purchased this item and will probably look for a product from a different manufacturer given my feelings about Roku.

  Initial impressions (which I will update after using the device for a few weeks)Yes, it was easy to hook into my TV.Yes, it seems to be easy to use and so far I am impressed with many of the features and content optionsBUT, they use dark patterns (evil tricks) to try to get you to input your credit card as part of the set-up process. Having a credit card is NOT needed for many of the features and content sites and they have obviously chosen to make it VERY frustrating for those users who would prefer not to give out their credit card information before choosing to make a first purchase. A simple ¨Skip this step for now¨ button  is all that they need. But they chose to hide that  feature and so they get a lousy review for having made their new device a pain to  use during set-up. Shame on you, Roku![Updated review]. After having owned this device for a while, I can say that it works great. Streaming via services like Disney+ works like a charm, and I continued to be impressed by the content on the Free Roku channel. If it was not for their sad attempts to trick you into putting your credit card into their registration system, I would give this 5 stars.

  let me start by saying I love Roku devices I feel they are better than Amazon fire sticks and fire TVs and they are nowhere near as costly as the other options on the market from Apple.Unfortunately we've had nothing but Problems with the YouTube app not displaying full resolution, problems with HDMI connection not working and problems with Wi-Fi to remedy these issues a hard reset or restart was required every time.also I paid $27 to pre-order this product at a discount of $3 from its normal price of $30 then the device less than two weeks later is on sale for $24 and its predecessor is on sale for $22So in summary this new Roku premiere is less capable has Wi-Fi issues, app issues, and HDMI connection issues and sells for more then the previous model which had none of these problems and was sold at a higher rate at pre-order price then it is currently being sold at the time of this review at $24, buy the older version Roku premiere at $22 to save yourself some headaches

  This lil device is great for the price. Set-up was not difficult even for a Luddite like me (just make sure you have your passwords to any streaming services handy). However, BEWARE, and apparently this happens a lot (you can google it), when given a code and prompted to register my device, I entered the URL on the screen in my mobile device web browser and clicked on the first website that came up, which turns out to be a scam website. Someone on that site with barely intelligible English told me I did not have a Roku account (I did) and that due to a lawsuit I would need to pay $70 to register my device. Luckily I hung up and went over to my desktop to enter the URL in the top, which took me to the Roku website where registration was free and easy. So far I am very impressed with the device; the loading of programs seems much faster than my old Roku player and the image quality is very good considering my ancient TV and slow DSL connection.

  We needed to downsize our monthly cable bill so were returning the rented converter boxes and instead bought Roku Express.  Set up was very easy, the Roku system is very affordable (they have several different models to fit your needs) and the Express was all we really needed.  We continue to rent cable service and now have our Roku Express set up which was a very easy thing to do.  Now we not only get cable service (through the streaming system) but we get a lot of other free channels/shows/movies/tv that we didn't get before.  Another perk...no more ugly cables exposed as everything is plugged directly into the back of the tv.  Great reception with a reduced monthly cable bill.  We were so impressed that we now have all of our sets hooked up to Roku Express, even a smart tv that had no cable hookup located in our sunroom.  This is a great way to hook up a smart tv on your patio as well...you will just need one outlet for electrical hookup and Roku will do the rest.  Thanks Roku!

  I have a number of Roku devices in my house but this one is really tiny and inexpensive.  It works extremely well.  I paired it with a video projector, (see attached), and basically have a portable HD movie machine capable of up to 176"".  The other image attached shows the quality of the picture on a 100"" screen.  You simply cannot beat the price of this Express unit.Other reviewers have reported some fee to register the device.  There is NO fee to register it with Roku.  I have on my account two Roku-3 units, one older Roku-2, this Roku Express and 3 Roku TVs, (none of which required any registration fee).The only caution before purchasing this device is that you have a good WiFi signal as this little unit does not have an Ethernet input jack.  It operates only via WiFi.

  Bought this to stream Amazon prime videos but unfortunately never used it because of the unreasonable (my opinion) set up data requirements.  Connection to my TV and WiFi network was easy. The unit powered up and the ""set up"" menu appeared as expected. The menu directs you to login to the Roku web site with a second device to activate your unit. The Roku site requires you set up a Roku account to activate your unit.This is where I ran into my issue with the device. To set up an account you MUST enter your name, your address, your gender, your date of birth and your credit card information. Gender, address and birthday info is irrelevant and none of their bloody business as far as I'm concerned. Credit card information is also irrelevant if I only use the free streaming videos.So, unless you don't mind providing personal information to a unknown entity on the internet don't waste your money on this item. It make work very well, what little I saw worked fine, but blindly providing unnecessary personal information on the internet to any entity is foolish.

  i needed this only for amazon prime. i have satellite internet (i live in the country) with limited data. setup was easy, though roku will ask you what channels you subscribe to (i said none) what your interests are (i didn't select any) and what channels you want to add (they're free to add! - they don't tell you you'll pay for content). then it ignored all of that and spent fifteen minutes installing 30 channels on my device. between that the and immediate software update, it used 600 MB of my precious data. but wait, it gets worse! the amazon prime app on this device doesn't allow you to select streaming quality, so it was streaming at 1080p burning through 1.5 GB/hour of programming. also, the video and audio were out of sync and the app failed to connect about 75% of the time, telling me my internet connection was bad when every other app on the device could see the internet just fine. and then, of course, there's the constant advertising on the roku home screen. it's going back and i'll just buy dvds for the shows that come 'free' with my amazon prime subscription. cheaper in the long run and i can watch off line. oh, i wasted almost an hour with four different techs on amazon chat trying to fix the issues (they kept handing me off) to no avail. a lot of this may be amazon's fault (they've crossed the line to evil now), but bottom line is it doesn't do what i need.

  Sooooo excited to have this!!!I just moved away from home and, admittedly, never had to worry about TV channels (I always just got on Netflix on my laptop anyways). But now that I’m on my own, I realized I now have a TV and A) had no idea how to stream to it and B) was getting tired of watching Netflix ALL the time but wasn’t ready to pay for cable. I know I’m extremely late in the game but I just didn’t realize just how many options are available to you with Roku!! (Maybe others as well? Not sure) so many free channels, but even if you want to pay for others it’s still so much cheaper than paying for cable aloneThe actual device is tiny and so easy to use. Comes with all HDMI/other cords you need. Comes with a sticky piece to attach smaller pieces where the remote points to your TV. The remote you can download as an app on your phone is also super handy and you can browse channels very easily - screenshots included. Such a great investment.

  This is my third Roku. I was having difficulty with my second device seeming to need to buffer every few seconds and the remote not responding. I found some information online the gave tips on how to determine if it was the device itself or the remote and running through that process determined that the device itself had probably worn out. So I decided to get a new one and this version was just coming out the middle of October so I placed an advanced order and received it around the 15th. It was extremely easy to set up, except for the hassle of having to go online, enter code, verify etcetera. But once that was done I don't want her had problems with thanks I wanted to watch buffering constantly. And this device is so small it fits in the palm of my hand and I've got small hands.I live in a building built out of concrete and surrounded by a bunch of other concrete buildings. So my television reception is iffy. When I try to watch a channel through my antenna I'm just as likely as not to have the program cut off midstream. So I pretty much given up watching regular TV. But my Roku provides me with my entertainment.I would highly recommend this device for anyone needing a replacement for an old Roku or for someone just now taking the plunge to purchase a streaming device. My second one that this replaced is the only one that is actually worn out. I still have the first one that I purchased and use it in my studio. So these little devices have been great investments.

  I purchased the Roku Express after hours of research on streaming products. I know streaming is old but it is new to me.  This is the first time that I have purchased a streaming device. First, I want to say the set up is quick and easy. I am not a computer geek however this took no time to complete. It included everything that I needed to set up.  All I did was connect the cables and plugin.Another thing is there is NO EXTRA CHARGE FOR Activation. The reason I say this is because quite a few people say that it is. Please read the instruction book and use the URL that will take you to Roku.com.  It should not take you to a google page.  If it does you are on the wrong page. If you use that site you will get a con artist. These people will say that you need to pay to activate.  THIS IS NOT TRUE.We are using the Roku in the bedroom. Soon as it was activated it was ready to use. I needed to purchase one for a second tv.  The remote that comes with it does not have a volume button. That just means you have to use your regular remote. Or you can make your phone a remote. That set up is so easy. There is plenty to stream for free or other streaming channels you have to purchase.Another thing is,  Roku activation does ask for a Credit Card. I do know a lot of people do not want to keep the Roku because of this. At first, I was apprehensive. But you put in a pin. This keeps that anything purchase I have to manually have to authorize it. That makes me feel safe. Any purchases on my credit card I will know right away on my telephone alert. I am finally ready to cut the cable cord. I am tired of paying $200 a month.  I am sure I will use Sling TV.  Make sure you have a good internet speed. Check how much your uploads are. Just know that  Roku itself has a channel for free movies. This little express powerhouse comes with so many movies and hours of entertainment. I am going to buy a second one for sure. Do not hesitate to buy it. Easy setup and hours of entertainment.

  Don't know how many people are like me. Finally had to replace my 1st generation Roku 2100X box that just kept chugging away until it stopped loading Amazon Prime. For $30.00 I figured I couldn't go wrong. First impression, I was right. Since I already had a Roku box attached to my TV, it was super easy to unplug the old one and plug in the new one. The ""box"" itself is super small. Luckily they include a double sided sticky strip that holds the device in place. Set up was also very easy. It automatically detected the Wi-Fi and then it walks you through all the steps on your TV screen. Adding channels also really easy. The interface is very different from the old version. But since I'm the last guy on the block to get to the party, this is obviously the new look. I don't need a lot of bells and whistles - just something that will do the job of streaming the channels I actually watch. So far, this is a winner.

  My 60"" Panasonic Plasma TV sits on a nice TV table.  I prefer to have my Roku device sitting on the TV table, not attached to the TV. I am reasonable tech literate. I was VERY surprised at the 2-foot length of the enclosed HDMI/HDMI chord. It  flat out wasn't long enough. Very annoying to have them skimp on the chord. Fortunately, I had a longer cable and used that one. Next issue: when I used my cable TV remote, it would change input from cable TV to Roku. I would have to disconnect the Roku every time. This is not acceptable!  Fortunately, I was able to solve it. On your Roku go to Settings/System/Control Other Devices. Choose One touch Play. Then uncheck that option. When checked, then any other remote will trigger a Roku input. That should really be unchecked by default!! There was also some additional pains to log in to each app (Netflix, Prime, Hulu, Apple-TV for me), but this is to be expected. Once the aforementioned issues  (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5), it appears to be working very very well! Oh, and the IOS remote works great too

  What a piece of Junk. So I bought this because my horrible cable supplier in their infinite wisdom has decided that they only want to work on a Roku (Xfinity). Had it a total of a month. Guess what it updated last night. Guess what it doesn’t work anymore. Had to do a factory reset. I’ve been a loyal Apple TV owner for over 5 years. Guess what. This has never happened to me using their product. Never did I have to reset back to factory to actually get the product to work after a reset. If it wasn’t exactly one day over my return this POS would be going back. What junk. Stick with an Apple TV if you can.  Much better product. Yeah you definitely get what you pay for!

  needed a device to sling with (none of my existing devices could)- this thing has a media player built in which is a little more sexy than the one my set has, also a wireless capability that my old set did not have so yeah the device really whipped into shape my lovable old tv:)well, after about a month of use I have to say this roku express is definitely the LEAST robust wireless device in my home. located in the same place as a couple of smart tvs and a wireless computer the roku seems to have significant streaming issues - the connection check always passes but still lots of issues - while my other devices still perform without problems - don't know if I should be mad at roku or sling for making me get the device in the first place...boo hoo :)still seeing streaming issues - don't really know what the issue is - may not be the roku device, could be the sling service(that is what i am using when i see the problems) or it could be spectrum isp ...just can't tell - beginning to believe it is probably the sling service - both roku and spectrum have been at it longer?whatever,think i must have been having ISP issues - everything looks real good today and i am finding extra stuff to access through the ROKU - back to 5 stars:)nope...back to one star rating - just can't get reliable video streaming, i am now streaming sling and amazon prime thru a windows pc which seem to work just fine - not as convenient but reliable - amazon music still seems to stream basically ok and the media player for intranet content seems to work ok - just seems like my internet does not like the ROKU...so again, it may work for you just not for me...ok, like the 6th update to this review - i moved an electric floor fan away from the Roku area - internet streaming seems flawless now - electric interference? (remember what turning on a vacuum cleaner did to antenna tvs?)so at worst the Roku is more subject to interference but overall is a good product - i hope this review is finally over:)

  I've been a Roku user since 2008.  There have been some ups and downs, but overall it's been a very positive 11+ year experience.This device, however, is absolutely terrible.  The picture is constantly pixelated with terrible artifacting.  The picture quality makes everything completely unwatchable.  It reboots randomly.  I've had it plugged in for less than an hour and it's rebooted itself about 8 times.This roku is the most unusable in the product line.  I'm switching back to my Roku 2 XS for now.  That thing was pretty solid (at least compared to this).I would not recommend this to anyone.  It's a complete waste of money.  Spend the extra and get one of the higher end devices.  You get what you pay for, I suppose.

  I own or have owned nearly every version of Roku. I find this box for the price to be a very good deal. Compared to my Ultra or 4k streaming Roku stick, it's performance is acceptable. Yes, the higher priced ones are nicer, include things like headphone jacks, better wifi, etc. But for the price, this one performs above expectations, is easy to set up, and is a great value. The only thing really lacking is the ability to program the TV on/off and volume, I assume that feature was left off for price purposes.

  Closed Caption does not work on Amazon Prime.  You can go to settings and set it up for CC but it won't work.  On some other channels, it might work....  then it might not.  A good way to check if it will work is to press the option button *.  If you don't see it listed, it won't work even if the media says it's CC and there is an option for subtitles.  Sometimes the subtitles don't work!I have other versions of Roku and they work.  This version does not.  Which leads me to think that Roku has contracted with another supplier and they screwed up.Oh... I read where Roku suggested the stereo option on Audio should be on.  That didn't work either.Time to return this unit for a replacement.  If that works, I'll update this review.  If not, assume it didn't work.Edit Feb 16, 2020The replaced behaved as the first.  This time, I set CC to replay in the settings/accessibility/CC section.  When I returned to Prime Video, the CC was working.  However, when you hit the * button, you do not have the option for CC to turn it off or always on.  I then went to Roku Channel and any media that would have CC would not work.  But, after pressing * button, the CC option was there.  I changed it from replay to always on.  CC was then displayed on the screen.  I returned to Amazon Prime and sure enough CC was still working, but as I said earlier the * CC option would not display.  I now returned to settings and noticed that CC is set for always on.The conclusion is that there is a software programming glitch related to the setting/accessibility/CC setup and the * option setup when viewing.  The workaround is to set CC to replay in the setting/accessibility/CC setup. Go to Roku Channel, play a media, and use * option to set CC to always on.  This should work.In closing:Disability is a frame of mind.  We're not disabled.  We simply don't hear.  Some people can't speak more than one language.  Some can't figure out math.  Some will never be doctors.  We are not disabled, simply different.  So lets get this CC working, ok?.... and all the bar flies can read the shows as they drown their sorrows.

  Never ever buy this product. For one the picture quality is absolutely terrible and it also goes in and out to the point that it’s blurrier than tv was before high definition. It also messes up my sound bar about 3-4 times for each show that I watch which means I am constantly resetting my volume. The TV ads are much much louder than the actual shows which can be startling so make sure you mute the volume every time the ads are about to come on. Also every single time I watch Netflix there is no volume and I have to exit out and reset my Roku several times before the volume will work on Netflix. Over a week ago two of my channels stopped working. Anytime I try to watch a show on one of those two channels it takes me back to the home screen. I called customer support and explained to them what was going on and the lady at the Indian call center put me on hold for five minutes and came back and told me that if I just waited it out it would correct itself and then she literally hung up on me. It’s been about eight or nine days since I made that call and I still am unable to watch either of those channels. DO. NOT. BUY. A. ROKU. I’d give negative stars if it were an option.

  Bought this because I have bought other ROKU products and they have performed well.  ROKU Express - much different experience.  Fired it up, added some services and it only displays on the top left 1/4 of screen.  Read ROKU forums and found a large amount of people who have had the same experience.  One of the suggested fixes was simply unplugging the power supply and trying again.  After re-powering, it comes up with the R-O-K-U bouncy letters and the screen goes black.ROKU Express is just dead.I can't send it back.  I already have authorized services on it.

  What I like: Great user interface, easy to setup, and unlike my Fire TV Stick, ROKU Express includes an app-channel for Spectrum which works really well, almost don't need the Spectrum cable box.What I don't like: No support for 5 gHz wifi connections. This should not matter as the 2 gHz connection should provide enough bandpass but evidently it is barely sufficient for HD viewing.  Second, the screen quality is like going back a generation or two. The Fire TV Stick provides a brilliant, clear, incredible display--the ROKU is not even in the ball park. Finally, there is no speech recognition through the remote. I have become used to just pushing-holding a button and speaking a command.I would definitely return the ROKU Express however I like the Spectrum support, so I will keep it. But dang, can't anyone build a streaming stick that does it all?????

  I cut the cable cord quite some time ago and have used Chromecast to cast movies I have on a two terrabyte external drive to my television via my laptop, but for watching regular shows, I have Youtube TV which has my local stations plus many others including USA, TNT and others so with the Roku, I can watch shows as we ""used to"" many years ago before cable or I can watch the alternate channels like AMC or USA without being tethered to or paying for cable.  I really enjoy Roku for the flexibility it allows - I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to dump cable.  You do need an internet connection, but that's it.

  Very disappointed with this device. Every week it disconnected from the Wifi and in order to get it connected to the internet again I would have to do a factory reset. No matter how many times I would input the password it would tell me that the password was incorrect. On some occasions it would accept the password only to disconnect from the WiFi a few moments later. I also tried doing the network reset option and that didn’t work either. Unplugging the device or doing a factory reset were the only things that (most of the time) would get me back onto the WiFi. I even doubled checked my password by disconnecting my iPhone from the WiFi and connecting it again using the same password and it connected with no problems. There is no way to turn off the device, so it stays on. I feel like this may be what could be contributing to the issues that I am experiencing. If that wasn’t enough of a pain in the a**, every time I did a factory reset I would need to input the login information for every one of my streaming services. Most of the reviews on this device seem positive so I’ll just end by saying that I may have received a defective device but if you do experience these issues return the device right away and get your money back while you still can.  Unfortunately, I thought the issue was solved when I did the first factory reset and missed the return cut off date. Going to try my luck with FireStick.

  UPDATE:  Within a short time the screen started turning pink and we lost volume on a repeating basis.  We would unplug the unit which was hot, let it cool and replug, only to have it occur again and again.  Waste of money.  Glad I got product protection, but still ridiculous that this product is so poorly made.I can only compare this to my Amazon Fire Stick and Xfinity remote, and there is absolutely no comparison.  The set up took a long time simply because this Roku would not pick up the router signal.  Firestick, the laptop, smart phone, the tablet and Alexa all pick up the router in the exact same location, but Roku kept missing it and giving out error messages.  I had to plug the Roku into another tv closer to the router/modem to complete set and then move it back to its intended tv to get it to work.  Once set up was completed, Roku somehow found the router signal that it could not find during set up and now I have service.  We use it to stream Xfinity beta on a tv with no tv box.  The remote is clunky and time consuming to use. There is no surfing from channel to channel.  You have to hit return, or often go back to home and start the tv search all over again.  The best you can do is go back to recent channels or plug into favorite channels, and even these steps are time consuming.  I realize that this is an entry level unit at less than $30, and that these streaming devices are one size fits all gaming pieces intended to pick up many different services.  But with the sophistication of today's technology, one would think they could produce something that better emulates a tv remote.  I am not asking for voice activation (available on more expensive models), just the ability to surf through channels without going back and forth, left, right and home.  Channel up, channel down does not seem much to ask for.  But it does pick up tv service.  The picture quality is inferior to Firestick on the same tv,  just fair.  There is no volume control--must use the tv remote for that.

  I got an email from Roku.  It said that my Roku 2 is many generations behind the newest devices and that they will no longer issue software updates.  Although my current Roku works fine I thought that maybe it's time to upgrade to a new device.I received the Roku Express and installed it.  It simply will not connect to my Netgear R7000 Nighthawk router.  I currently have over a dozen devices that connect to my router: 2 desktops, 3 laptops, an iPhone 8, 2 Android smartphones, an Android tablet, an Android smart TV, a DVR and the old Roku 2.The Roku Express finds my WiFi network but it will not connect.  The troubleshooting guide says I should check my password and nothing else.  There is no advanced settings tab to change settings.  The Roku Express will connect to my hidden, guest network but then says there is no internet connectivity.I'm returning the Roku Express.  I'll continue to use the old Roku 2 until it dies and then I'll look at an Amazon Fire or some other streaming device.

  This is completely useless. I have it directly above my wifi extender. It''s not more than a foot and a half away from it and I can't keep this thing connected. I can't sign into any of my streaming channels because after I am done entering my information it has a network connection error. The wifi card in this thing must be an absolute piece of garbage. This is such a waste of money. I didn't want a stick because a use an HDMI splitter and you can't use a stick and plug in anything else.

  Systems Admin, 13 years here. I bought this as a Christmas present for my son. Hook it up Christmas morning in his room, and the ROKU tells me to log into my wireless network so it can update. No problem, I get it online, it says there's an update, and that it needs to download it. It does, and then the screen goes black. I wait 45 mins in case it's a big one, but nothing. Power device off, Roku logo comes up, then black screen. Off to Google, and it looks like a 30 sec reset is needed. Do it once, it resets, same thing, dead. Do it twice, still dead.

  Bought a Sony Bravia Smart TV back in 2013 which I could use for Netflix, Hulu, Spotify,  Amazon Prime, TED talks ....and a slew of other apps/channels. Fast forward to 2019 where only Netflix still works and I've received notifications from Hulu and Amazon that my Smart TV is no longer supported.  Back in 2013 I paid more than +$2000 for it.Enter the Roku Express HD  I bought for $29 on a Cyber Monday deal.  For almost 1/100th of the original TV it brings live back to my TV set.  I already had a Google Chromecast and still have that attached to my Sony.  But the Roku interface +  TV remote makes it much easier to use. Especially for guests like my elderly father, who probably isn't going to like fiddling with a smartphone to cast with Google Chromecast.  So that way the Roku is just easier and simpler to use.Points taken off for the following.a)  Plug for USB power does not provide 5V with 1Amp. Its less than that, but it is enough amps to drive the Roku Express HD, which needs very little power. The plug power rating is incorrectly stated on it.b) The iOS Roku app doesn't always work with a keyboard. This is useful when search for movies and entering passwords, which you're doing a lot in the beginning when signing up to  Netflix, Hulu, Amazon ,  YouTube.....etc. etc.They should fix the keyboard handoff to the smartphone Roku app. Using the Roku remote can be somewhat slow and tedious, so I found a work around.  The Roku app on iOS was inconsistent when it would work or not. The Roku physical remote being simpler always worked.Overall great product to give a 2nd life to an ageing and abandoned Sony smart TV.  I'm sure my smart TV isn't the only one out there.

  We are working at eliminating our satellite TV subscription.  We have a Roku Tv and I got an Amazon Fire stick for another tv.  It worked great but needed a couple more.  My daughter pointed to these because they were $21 on Prime Day.  I read some reviews about needing a credit card and account to set up. Almost didn’t buy, but in seeing those reviews debunked I did.  So glad I went through with it.  Extremely easy to set up.  Got one for my camper as well.  It asks for a card to have on account for future purchases but you can skip that without entering.  I forgot I had set up a free account with Roku when I got our TV.  It brought over my channels I like on the new setup.  Get the free remote app.  We love it.  I will say we have this experience on a small somewhat older TV.  We plugged the usb power cord into the usb on the tv and were experiencing our shows would seem to time out on YouTube TV.  We plugged it back into wall power and that stopped.

  I bought the Roku for three reasons:1) I wanted streaming services on my TV2) I wanted to be able to search through all the services, at once.3) I wanted to broadcast my desktop computer to my TV, instead of having to mess around with multiple HDMI cables.As a streaming stick, the Roku works perfectly. Shudder, Hulu, Showtime, Boomerang, Amazon, IMDB, I got them all working without any issue.  Twitch, for whatever reason, was a bit more difficult; I had to download one of the ""third party"" Twitch apps. The remote works well, and I've also used my Smartphone as a remote without problem.As an aside, the smart phone app is very good. You can control the entire Roku from your phone, and can have the audio come out of your phone's speakers or headphones. This could be a potential workaround for wanting to watch TV with headphones on, if you don't have a TV that supports wireless headphones.Roku's search function supposedly searches through all the available streaming services, but I found it unreliable. Sometimes I would type in the name of a movie, and Roku would tell me it's on Tubi or a similar service. But sometimes I'd search for a movie, get no results, but then later find it on Tubi or elsewhere.  The ""JustWatch"" app on my smart phone still works better than the Roku search, for finding what is on which services.Wirelessly broadcasting from my computer to my TV was... mixed. It works well for movies, I notice no lag when I'm watching video files or youtube.  For video games, or even desktop browsing, the input lag makes most video games unplayable:  You'll move the mouse or joystick, and it'll move on the TV a whole second later.  I configured it for gaming, but still notice the problem.  Your mileage may vary.The Roku does most things well, but isn't perfect. If you just want to watch streaming services, you'll likely have no issues. But if you want some of the more advanced features, I say approach it cautiously.

  We have one of these in another room (an upgrade from an older model) and installation  was a breeze.  Great picture  quality.  My only complaint is the remote .  It sucks.We just bought a second one for another room, also to replace an older model.  It will connect to our WiFi network, but not to the Internet.  We’ve rebooted our router. We have a WiFi extender in the room. We’ve unplugged the Roku device, plugged it back up repeatedly, and it still won’t connect to the Internet.  The only troubleshooting advice I could find online was “contact your ISP” with nothing on screen to enable us to do that.  This makes no sense.  I may try calling them anyway, but it’s completely illogical.We didn’t have to do this with the one we bought for the other room. It makes no sense that it’s a problem in a different room.At this point, I’m a big “thumbs down” on Roku devices.  And did I mention that the remote control devices suck?

  I bought one of these devices for the simple reason of wanting to view Netflix and Amazon Prime on my television rather than being limited to my phone and Ipad.  I barely had it a few days before I was asking myself why I hadn't got one months, or years, earlier.  I had no idea of the existence of 'free' television services (Stirr, Pluto TV and more) that were available on this device in addition to those I had subscribed to.  It wasn't long after my first Roku purchase that I got 3 more Roku's for the other televisions in my home and ditched cable after 25+ years.  Between 'renting' our four cable boxes, paying for service, and paying a 8.95 a month FCC fee, our cable service through Spectrum was costing us about $160.00 a month. We no longer get local channels but can pick up one of our local news station broadcasts through a Stirr channel.  If you are not a big tv watcher at all or are the type who typically doesn't watch the newer shows on the big 3 channels (ABC, NBC, and CBS) then Roku in lieu of cable might be for you.  On another note, I'm the type that doesn't care at all for the Alexis/Google/voice command equipment, so if you can relate Roku is the standard, push button device that doesn't listen to you, though you can buy additional equipment to make it happen if that's the route you prefer.'

  Shame on me for letting this product sit around for a couple of months before I got around to installing it.  Decided to do this on Dec 6th, 2020 on a rainy day.  Instructions make it look easy.  And it was at first.....long story short, when going through the setup of the product you enter an e-mail address that sends you an activation link.  First time failed?  Second time was a success.  Went through the process and got the congratulations page.  Sitting on the TV was the page that simply showed my e-mail th link would be sent to and a * option that gave yo the option to reset the device.  Also, it stated the link would expire in 15 minutes.  Ok. Great.  I completed the process as stated above and finished out.........now what?  Page is still shown on the TV stating it would send me a link.  Do I turn it on and turn it off.  The * option, just gave me options to reset the deive to factory defaults or restart the device.  So, I cut it off vis the power button on the remote and upon starting back up it either goes back to the page showing a link will be sent or starts the process all over again.  It's stuck in a loop.  What's worse is the website sucks too.  Go to the roku support website and it asks for the category of support needed and then the model number and...........no continue button, no page refresh for that model, nothing.  Page just looks like it was not finished by the developers.  How could it suck this bad?  Oh, and if you finally find the Roku support number you get a recording saying they no longer offer phone support due to Covid-19.  They don't offer chat support either.  Looks like I will have to choose another product to cut the cord.  Obviously for Roku to be aorund as long as they have they have got to have some good products......or just nose dived and started sucking hard on Dec 5th 2020 or somewhere around that time frame.  Anyway, that is my experience.  Still going to try a few things.  I'll post if I make progress.

  Set-up directs you to a web site to complete account set-up by entering a code from screen. Web-site says code is locked and gives number to call. Call goes to third party, Hern IT, that charges $80 to initiate account which is against Roku's advertised policy. This is a scam and since it is built into device, I suspect Roku is in on it. Called Roku and was told they warn against thrid party scams. Then why does their set-up direct you to one?

  I bought 3 Rokus in the last 18 months. I was very happy until about a week ago when all 3 started ""hanging"" or buffering. Investigation revealed that all 3 think I have a poor internet connection coupled with a strong wireless signal. All my other devices cellphones exhibit strong fast internet with download speeds >55 Mbps. The Roku devices think it's about 1 MBPS. First time that I had to contact customer support and I discover there is none (just for billing issues). There are many Community complaints but no real solutions (and why should the Community spend countless hours experimenting with possible solutions). My one-star rating is probably generous!

  I have read similar reviews here: during the installation, the roku.com website forced me to submit my payment information. Instead of giving my credit card info, I used PayPal, then it forced PayPal to create a charge. I did not approve the charge, then, the installation was locked out. I then repeated the process, this time instead of moving forward with payment, I hit the back button of the browser, then it let me finish the installation.I don't think this is a malware, but it is Roku's intention to force customers into giving them payment information.SO LAME!!!

  First of all let me say as far as the device, it's easy to set up, works great and seams a little faster than my older Roku Streaming sticks 3500, BUT IT ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT WORK WITH A 10 YEARSOLD VIZIO TV, THAT WORKED WITH MY ROKU STREAMING STICK.  I bought this Roku Express just to upgrade and to put my older streaming stick in guest bedroom.  But not matter what I did, after plugging in , correctly I might add, it would keep coming up on screen with no support. I researched Roku support community and it turns out many people were having this same problem. I did all of the troubleshooting that was suggested, checking cable tightness, plugged in my old one and changed from auto detect, to 1080  and 720 it made no difference. Since it is older and the TV itself doesn't have a way to manually upgrade firmware,  There was nothing else to do. I took  Roku Express,  in the spare bedroom, plugged it in and in literally seconds the setup screen was on and I had it setup in a couple of minutes.  Then I tried it on my Vizio again , same thing , no support error message on screen.  Then I unplugged it and put in on my Haier TV which is also older model, and it worked perfectly.  So if you have an older Vizio you might want to check and see if it's compatible. I couldn't find this information on the Roku site but it should be out there somewhere.  Anyway the device itself is really nice, quick setup on compatible TV, but did not work on older model Vizio.

  I received my Roku Express HD today and began setting it up. Following the instructions provided to the letter I began setting up a Roku account so I could activate my Roku. Part way through it asked for my credit card or PayPal information. Apparently, there is no way to activate the device without doing this. I am unwilling to do this just so I can use their product. I am returning it and getting another Firestick because a Firestick does not require a credit card to use it.

  The newly 'compact' remote is fine - but hard to figure out where things are by 'feel' - buttons too 'flat' can't distinguish between 'arrows' and ok - also, every 10-15 minutes just drops - no reason and you have to go all the way back to where you were - and you lose several minutes of show - have to figure out where you were 'resume' does not go back to when Roku dropped . . . very frustrating - primarily with Amazon Prime Video - maybe why there is no ""Prime Video"" button on the new remotes . . .  I like the 3 version better but I do like being able to 'stick' the Roku onto the TV keeping it in place.  Miss the older versions picking up remote signal from almost anywhere - not this newer one though you have to aim almost exactly . . . hard to do in the dark and the Roku 'light' is way to tiny and dim.  Though it is only $24 - you get what you pay for.

  I have used this 3 months.  I do not have a 4k TV.  Roku lets you install any app.I have an old Apple TV hooked up to my main TV.  It came with pre-loaded apps and does not allow you to update it.  So I bought this new Roku for that TV so I could watch Disney + and the new Formula 1 app only works on Roku devices.The ac/dc to USB adapter arrived broken.  Since I had another one, I did not return this.I like the interface on my old Roku 3.This one though begins playing video & sound of any show your cursor lands on after a few seconds as you scroll along looking to see what show you want to watch next.It cannot be turned off and is extremely annoying!So, unless I""m watching Disney+ or a new  app, I continue to use the old Apple TV device to stream things.Neither this one or the old one accepts a memory card.  The old one has to reload apps when you pick one.  Perhaps this one has enough memory built in, as I haven't noticed it doing that.THE REMOTE:The remote has four buttons, one for Netflix, Hulu,  Sling and Disney+I do not use these and think they are a waste of space.Besides those 4 buttons, there are twelve more.  Why is it that my Apple TV gets by with half as many?The old Roku remote had hard plastic, much more pronounced buttons.  This new one has a slight rubber texture and are very slim.  Also, they moved the OK button within the circular pattern of arrow keys.  I find these buttons harder to use in the dark.

  This is my 4th or 5 roku so I know what I am doing with them. Bought this one for Moms house and it has major problems. It restarts itself every few hours. The picture freezes every 3 or 4 minutes. Audio is out of sync, statisticy and distorted. I replaced the HDMI cable, restarted, multiple times, changed all the setting as I know some audio problems can be fixed that way but nothing helped. I hooked an older roku up and it worked flawlessly so I know for sure it is the new just bought roku. Contacted Amaaon about getting it replaced and had to spend 30 minutes arguing with support. Finally got them to replace when I said never mind I will just return it and buy 1 at walmart.No need of the lack of customer service and aggravation I had to go though to get a brand new item that is defective replaced.

  Best $30 ever spent.  Bought for my moms dumb tv.  She doesn’t end up needing it, so I was gonna return it.  But my not so smart tv been having issues connecting to WiFi so I decided to give Roku a shot.  Oh man, no issues.  What is Roku?  Basically a platform that hosts Streaming services like Disney +, ESPN, Hulu, prime, etc.  all on one user friendly interface.  Those require paid subscription but Roku has free streaming services.  Yes free.  Movies, shows, documentaries, weather, news...etc.  How does it work?  Connect Roku to tv via hdmi cable.  Plug adapter into outlet.  Make sure your tv on correct source/input.  Roku will power on.  Connect to your WiFi.  Register your free account.  That simple.  If u have existing subscription streaming services,  enter login information.  I’ve heard of Roku but glad I did my research.

  I learned this today. If you already own a Roku and you're on a ""basic"" plan, whatever that is, if you buy another Roku before you can activate it you have to pay $100 for 3 years of premium service or $149 for a lifetime premium service. I am returning this and will buy a firestick.New Roku will fail to activate, telling you to call support.  When I called they said they would upgrade my account to premium.  When I asked if there was a charge, i was told the price.  When I said that I didn't want to do it, I was told that it was already done.  I was mad that I was tricked into extra charges.

  I did miss that is was only 2.4Ghz and I assumed it was only 5ghz. That is on me.Figured it will be ok for streaming the kids' shows (mostly 720p or less, with some new movies at 1080p)...As I bought this for PLEX streaming (mostly).Now, I have to transcode and downgrade the quality of EVERY show that streams to this device, regardless of original content quality. 480p is really all it seems to handle. The strength and stability of the WIFI signal are great, and the PS4 (launch model) does fine at equal distance and with 1 additional wall to beam through.My PLEX machine is strong enough to direct stream 1080p and transcode, without a hiccup, to at least 4 other devices spread around a 3-story home.The server and router are not the issue.I wish I could return it and pay the difference on another Ultra model; that one kicks ass.

  I bought this device to add to an older Sony Bravia TV that's attached to Xfinity. Setup was easy (I'm moderately tech-savvy), but it was all downhill from there. I got the Roku home screen, but it was very dark and colorless. I searched Google for a remedy: I had to go to anything streaming (any Netflix show, Sling, whatever), push the Options button, go to Picture Mode and adjust from there. Simple enough (though the Roku help site didn't tell me this); except it didn't work. Options gave me only two options, neither of which was helpful. I know more options should be available, because I have a Roku TV with lots of options. I called customer service, which told me that, because of the pandemic (it's June 2020), they have no live help. But I see from other reviews that they had no live help before the pandemic (Oct. 2019) either. I am sending this thing back, and am very disappointed in what I expected to be a great product.

  I've read reviews saying, ""If you're being asked to pay an activation fee ... then you're in the wrong place!"" Also you will find on Roku's website that they do not charge an activation fee, and any site asking for payment is a scam. Yet, it is the Roku device itself saying to click the activation link sent to my email, and said activation link SENDS YOU DIRECLY TO A PAYMENT PAGE. (And clearly this activation link is part of the roku.com domain)I got it working without paying an activation fee by closing the Roku webpage that asks for your payment info. Then I reopened my browser and went to the Roku site and signed into the account that I just created from the initial part of the sign-up process. Back on my TV/Roku, I had the activation link re-sent to my email -- I clicked it again, and then THIS TIME, at the very bottom of the payment page, was a teeny-tiny 'Skip This' link. Clicked that, then I was finally able to proceed without paying.The whole ordeal is definitely shady & unethical. Because while Roku openly claims they do not charge an activation fee, they are clearly trying to trap unsuspecting customers into paying the fee. They clearly have no qualms about taking your unnecessary payment if you fall into their trap and are willing to just pay the ransome.Shady & disgusting business. On top of taking customers' money, I would be extremely concerned about Roku selling off any & all information that they have on you to anyone looking to buy customer data ...

  Roku seems like a good idea but I have found no way to get the price of a channel before subscribing to it. I have not been able to find a channel subscription list with price anywhere on the net. I did find something that said add the channel to find out what it costs. I have done this with several channels and no price is listed. I went to the Help section on Roku and saw where a man’s bill was $1,500 and he was complaining he didnt understand the charges. This monthly Roku payment is charged directly to your credit card. Is it too much to ask the price before you decide to buy something? I will fiddle with this for awhile longer but will prob send it back. Cable has a set charge & you know what you’re buying & you get a bill for it....not just an unexplained Roku charge every month.

  We purchased this for our son’s room for him to watch Disney+ and YouTube TV, as his older smart TV didn’t support those apps. I was disgusted and incredibly disappointed by the screen savers available and the content available on this device.  I was NOT able to filter and block pictures of naked women from the screensaver store on this.  We are trying to safeguard our home and the content allowed in it, yet this thing was loaded with mature images that I could not block.  This needs revamped and redone.

  Everything seemed great with the Roku until I went back to watching cable TV. Went to look at the info for a program and the Roku home screen popped up. I tried hiding the Roku receiver behind the DVR but that didn't make a difference. I had to unplug the Roku to stop the problem. This was a situation caused by two problems. Apparently the DVR and the Roku must run on the same frequency and because the HDMI cord provided with the Roku is only 24"" long there wasn't a choice on where else to put the receiver except right next to the DVR. I had to switch out the HDMI cord with a 72"" one so I could place the Roku receiver four feet away from the DVR. Now if I am careful and aim the DVR remote at the DVR it seems to work. I guess for cost reasons Roku has decided to provide an exceedingly short HDMI cable with the unit. Seems a bit cheap on their part to me.

  UPDATE AFTER 3 MONTHS OF USE: This has been nothing but trouble. We have to reset it (pull power cord) about once a day.  About once a week it says ""not connected to the internet"" - which is funny, because everything else in the house is and works fine.  Sometimes unplugging it for 30"" will work.  Sometimes you have to do it 4-5 times.  Sometimes we give up, come back a few hours later, and miraculously, it somehow ""found the internet"" and works just like it was supposed to all along, la-de-dah.  If it's during the day and that happens, our grandson just finds something else to do.  He now knows the phrase ""The internet isn't working today"" as that's what we tell him.  If, however, this BS occurs in the evening when we'd like to watch a movie, that's another story because ""a few hours later"" means we'll be in bed.Our old unit never had this problem.  Yes, it was slower and didn't have some cool features, BUT IT WORKED RELIABLY.  This new unit is UNRELIABLE.I still have my old unit and I will probably end up going back to using that.  I can't return this POS as it's outside the return window, but lesson learned.  If you buy this, or any deluxe Roku unit and have ANY new trouble, return it IMMEDIATELY, even after the first time.  It is telling you that this is going to be your life with this upgraded technology.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Inexpensive and money well spent to upgrade from an old one.... we noticed the difference right away: it's faster and has more convenience features built in. I only wish the remote lit up like those excellent Comcast remotes, but with the Roku app, I don't even use the remote (but don't toss it - you might need it when your wireless connection goes flaky and suddenly your phone and Roku can't recognize one another... then you need the remote!)

  In order to use this device, you need to 1) set up an account and 2) provide credit card information.  If I had known that I never would have bought it.  Insidiously, it only asks for your credit card information *after* you've created an account; it's definitely not up-front about what information you need to provide *to begin using the device you already paid for*.Under normal circumstances I'd return it, but considering we're in the middle of a pandemic it's not worth a trip to the store where Amazon returns are accepted.  $21.00 wasted, and this device goes directly to the electronics recycling dump having been used 0 times.Never buy a Roku.UPDATE (several days later):  I created a new account, and at the point where it asks for credit card info (and there is no ""skip"" option evident), I clicked the ""do not sell my info"" link to take me out of the flow, to another page.  At that point I turned my Roku on, received an activation link via email and clicked on it.  From there I was taken back to a flow where the credit card page came up again, but this time it *did* have a ""skip"" option.  So I skipped it.At this point I can use the Roku without having provided a credit card, but you still shouldn't buy one.  There's no way of knowing when this workaround will stop working, and in any case getting the advertised ""plug it in, connect to the internet, and start streaming"" without an intervening ""enter your credit card details"" step shouldn't be like finding a hidden level in a video game.

  This was a rough experience when I first went to set it up and of course, because we are in a pandemic I struggled with getting assistance. Roku has NO one to answer the phones to help at all and when I'd gotten home to set it up after work, it was too late to see if Amazon could help me out.It took me through the set up process 10+ times. I'd put in all the information just for it to go through the process to go back to send a code and go through it all over again. BUT once it finally took it has been great ever since. I've been using Chromecast for years, which is nice to cast from your 📱 BUT I have found the Roku to be more convenient as I don't have to rely on my phone's battery power to enjoy my favorite shows AND it's great to see that there are even more apps/channels that I can enjoy for free. It's definitely replaced one of my Chromecast and I am thinking about getting a couple more to replace the other Chromecast in the house. Just love it. I do have the option to use my Echo to run my Roku even though I don't have a voice remote but I haven't tried it out just yet

  I use three different levels of Roku devices in the house, this review is for the Express edition. As a Roku, it is fine. As an add on device, it has issues. First, the remote is IR (infrared), which means you have to have line of sight between the remote the receiver to work. If you have a busy TV area, be prepared to re-design it to allow for lack of RF in the remote. Second, the included HDMI cable is very short, maybe 18 inches. So.....Roku first requires you to position the receiver to be visible to the remote but Roku then requires you do so within 18 inches of your HDMI input on the back of your TV. Oh, the fun. If you don't have a 6' HDMI cable, get one (adds another 10 bucks to the cost). Thirdly, the power cable is short. I think most people at this point have TVs mounted on their walls and so route their cables in a raceway or through the wall. If that's you, buy a 3 or 6 foot extension because you'll need it.And the icing on the cake? The ""I heart Roku"" sticker of course. Swap the sticker for a longer HDMI cable when you ship an add on device with an IR remote.

  Ordered a Roku Express, and it worked well initially, but then failed and needed to be replaced.  That happens, so just unlucky, but thats where the real headaches begin.  You can't call Roku support during the pandemic.  Not sure why, but thats how they are operating.  They dont provide a quick and easy way to chat or email them from their support website, and they make it very difficult to contact them and to determine how to deal with a defective product.  Eventually, I logged in on the support site, and there we finally found a way to tell the about our defective unit.  They responded with an email saying they will replace it, shipping out a new one when they receive the defective one, but they dont include a shipping address.  The email contains a link to an article on their website which also doesnt provide a shipping address.  Followed up with another email to Roku, and they said they would forward our email to another department to get us a shipping address.  We are still going through this back and forth with them.  I havent seen such terrible product support in a very long time.  Its almost as if they are trying to make it as difficult as possible for you to deal with a defective product.  So, great product as long as you dont get a defect, then the support really is awful.

  I bought this for my mother to help her transition with cutting the cord. There was no way she would be able to remember what app had each of her shows etc. & she loves her shows, true to the stereotype of post menopausal women I suppose (p.s. I am female so I can say this...)My issue is it seems like the apps don't get updates enough or something. For some reason hulu has issues constantly. No problems with tubi, netflix, amazon, peacock - all of those work great. But dammit - hulu, I need you to keep her happy & roku always throws an error message every couple of minutes. When I watch hulu on my xbox one - no problems with errors. Idk if it's because this is the least expensive roku or if it is all roku devices.I got her the little one for 2 reasons : 1. for someone who isn't used to these kinds of things/technology interfaces etc. it made sense to go with a simple one. 2. if she just couldn't figure it out, I didn't want to have bought a feature rich, expensive one that would ultimately end up in a box in the back of the closet. : she still has me searching for her favorite shows & if I'm there she loves having me start the shows for her - despite that she clearly does it on her own when I am not there. Who knows, maybe she fumbles through finding them by herself & doesn't want to feel embarrassed or have me see that & feel like I made a mistake by getting rid of her astronomical cable bill. (which I wouldn't, I would just spend more time going over it again with her a few times to help her learn, because I'm a good child.)Either way, it's working - she's dealing. & she's saving $130 a month at least.

  So, I can only ever let the device ""go to sleep,"" but can't ever turn it off like I can with my Amazon Fire Stick. Another issue I've had is that it malfunctions, so when I do wake it up, there's no sound and I have to unplug the device, wait a little, and then replug it back in for everything to work as usual. I'm unsure if it's just a faulty remote or if this is a common thing, but because of this, I'll likely just recommend the Amazon FireStick...plus, for the same price, the FireStick allows for volume control and talking to the remote (Alexa) to just pull up whatever it is you want to watch. To get those features on the Roku, I would have had to spend quite a bit more...still, all that aside, since I knew what I was purchasing, it's really frustrating having to reset my Roku every time I use it, so that I have sound.

  I was upset that I had to upgrade from my older Roku 2 because it was no longer able to stream You tube. Every time I clicked on the You tube icon it would start to load and then bounce back to the Roku home screen. This is apparently a very common problem as there are allot of supposed fixes online  for this problem. I tried all of the suggested fixes without any success. I did finally find that this problem is an issue with You tube and not Roku and decided to take a chance with the Roku Express. It did fix the issue I was having with You tube and it had other positives as well. Using it on You tube it responds much faster than my older Roku 2. It's also many times easier to fast forward and reverse videos on You tube which was always very problematic with the Roku 2. So if you are experiencing the You tube issue I describe, bite the bullet and get the Roku Express. Even though I was a bit upset about having to upgrade because of the You tube issue, the  much better performance I feel now made it worth it. Going to hold onto the Roku 2 and see if possibly a fix might be found for this issue in the future  and use it elsewhere in the house or possibly just give it to someone.

  Bought this for use with a 1080P Vizio television.  Using a Google mesh router system with about 50 mps internet access.  Streaming YouTubeTV. Continually had a problem with the program we were watching stalling - circular timing symbol - and never recovering.  Could often switch to another program and all would be fine but could not go back and finish the program we were watching.  Contacted Roku and tried all the troubleshooting techniques they suggested several times.  Finally they replaced the unit but we had the same problem.  Then they arranged a phone call and they wanted to walk me through the troubleshooting steps once again.  At that point I said I just wanted a refund but since I didn't buy it from them they were unable to do that, and the return window has closed on Amazon.We have three other Roku devices and they all work fine, and I moved a higher end Roku to the Visio and it works fine with that TV and in that location, so there is apparently something about this model that causes the problem.  The Roku tech said that it could be the mesh router system but since all our other devices work fine I seriously doubt that is the problem.Bottom line is that I like Roku devices and their overall system but I would not recommend this model.

  The most exciting thing about Roku Express HD Streaming Media Player 2019 is that you can stream xfinity channel line-up for your xfinity package.  You don't need an xfinity box to do so, therefore you don't have to pay to rent a box.  There are also so many channels to choose from.  I am a classic movie lover and I found so many classic movie channels, classic western channels and classic cartoon channels to choose from.  Great product for the price.  I will definitely purchase 3 more for the other 3 tv's in my home.

  I bought this device, and after 10 months I’m receiving a “low signal strength” error. 10 months of use, and suddenly this error. I tried all the usual fixes before contacting customer support. I even moved another Roku Tv to the same location, and it receives a great signal.  I’ve contacted support telling them of issue, and the things I’ve  to resolve it. After 3 days of back and forth, they tell me it’s my internet at fault, even though I’ve told them all other devices I’ve placed in the same exact location works fine, this is their advice . So, we put the non-working Roku on the tv that sets right next to router, and still have the same issueSo my advice is buy another brand, because if you have an issue, they will just email you and tell you it’s the fault of something else. Certainly not worth the $100 I spent on it.

  This product is very fussy. The remote has to be very close to the device and not blocked by anything, not even a small wire. It worked okay in the beginning, but then after restarting the device, it will not connect to my internet even though the password is absolutely correct. The forums on Roku that involve other users with the same problem have no resolution for this from Roku. They keep getting told to check their passwords even though they are in the same situation is me where we can verify that the passwords are completely correct. This is rather disappointing as a product since it's clear that support doesn't care that the product is not working anymore and is in bad need of some sort of update

  First and last one I buy. First thing is it has no OFF button so the unit stays warm all the time which can’t be good on longevity. Also eats data compared to other devices. It is easy setup but it freezes up a lot and you have to unplug it to start over and it doesn’t save what your watching to the correct spot. I have very fast WiFi for other devices and it still freezes with everything else turned off. I would guess a software problem.

  Works great, I reduced by cable bill a LOT by returning the cable boxes and the  DVR recorder and put this ROKU on the main TV.  I subscribed to a cloud service to record shows thru Spectrum (my cable provider) but I haven't been able to figure it out yet and they are swamped with calls due to the kids being home schooled and Spectrum offering free cable for new subscribers with children.  When things calm down I'll get in touch with them and get some advice (or drop the $5 a month for the cloud).  As of now almost everything I watch is on the ""on demand"" feature. I have to wait deal with some commercials, and there's a day lag on shows usually (I can deal with that for what I'm saving!)  I'll be getting more for the other TV's in the house.Works great with Netflix, Hulu and Amazon too if your TV isn't a smart TV.  The TV I'm using it on is a fairly new smart TV so I watch netflix and Hulu and Amazon through the (wired into the wall) TV and only use ROKU for my Spectrum TV, including news, etc.)Only (mild) less than glowing comment is the remote - it's simple  - too simple.  It would be great to be able to go to a channel rather than slowly glide down the list while holding the remote.  However I did find I can add shows to favorites and they'll show up on ""my list"" so that helps a lot.

  Overall it's an awesome product that delivers a ton of HD streaming options, and I'm very happy with it.  So let's skip past all the cool things that have already been said and go to one small flaw I've noticed: the remote control interface.  To explain: I got the Roku Express to replace an older ROKU Stick from years ago.  The main difference I've noticed between the newer Express model and the older Stick model: the Express unit can't just hang from/stick out of the back of my TV - it absolutely HAS to be positioned to face the front of the viewing area where you sit in order to receive input from the remote control, and the remote HAS to be aimed towards the Express when you use it (whereas the Stick could receive signals from the remote no matter where it was pointed...I could just leave the remote rested on an end table pointed it any odd direction - even backwards - and the Stick would faithfully accept remote input every time....not so with the Express).  That being said, this isn't a deal breaker because it isn't all that difficult to find the right spot to face the Express towards the front...and while the Express remote still doesn't work from every angle, it's good enough.  I also found a workaround solution for this issue by installing the Roku app on my smartphone - the app comes with a fully functional remote which for some reason DOES control the Express from any angle (just like the old Stick remote)...which begs the question, why didn't they just give the newer Express and remote the capability of interfacing at any angle like the older Stick model?  But again, aside from this one small gripe, the Express is so awesome in every other way that it's still worthy of five stars.

  I have multiple smart devices in my house including bluray players, cable boxes, and TVs. That being said I previously purchased 3 firestick HDs (which I love), and this Roku Express because the smart sticks seems to carry the bulk of all apps available and keep them updated. The only reason I got the Roku device over another firestick was because it supports the Xfinity Stream app and allows me to get live TV on my screened porch without needing to run a coax cable for a box... basically I want live sports out there. It works fine and accomplished what I wanted, but I much prefer the firesticks interface and what seems to be better developed apps and remote control with built in Alexa. The Roku is a little less intuitive and the interface is clumsy. I also can’t get Apple TV to login despite it being a supported device. All my firesticks set up much quicker and are easier to use. The Roku is about $10 cheaper than the firestick HD to be fair and it works perfectly fine, but if you don’t need something specifically only being offered on the Roku, I recommend going with the firestick HD. I haven’t investigated the Roku channels or specific apps so maybe there is some value there I haven’t picked up on yet.

  I put Roku sticks on all of my Samsung ""smart"" TVs because I was sick of dealing with slow updates and lack of apps.  My apps on Roku are kept up to date, but they still don't get all the features that Android TV devices get.  I have 5 Rokus, an Amazon Fire Stick, TiVo Stream, Apple TV, and Chromecast.  I went with all Roku because their apps are the most up to date and the user interface is easy.  After playing around with the Fire Stick and TiVo (both Android), I've found that those apps are just as up to date or more and I can side load any app I want.Roku and YouTube are in a heated battle right now and it looks like Roku might block YouTube because they can't come to an agreement.  I don't want a device that leverages its large user base to force providers into contracts.  I'm not a fan of the user interfaces on TiVo or Fire Stick, but at least they don't block me from side loading apps that aren't in the app stores.My advice to you is to find a pure Android TV device.  They aren't locked down to weird interfaces like Amazon & TiVo and they won't ever block you from putting any app you want on them.  They might cost a little more up front because they aren't making more off of you with tons of ads, but in the long run, they don't play politics and they don't have a say in which apps you get to have access to.I'll try to remember to update this when I find a good Android device.  I've heard really good things about Shield, but it's pretty expensive to add to ask of my TVs.

  If your ""smart"" TV has WiFi problems like both my Sony and LG TV's do, the Roku Express will likely solve those problems. I'm not saying it's perfect for everyone, as one reviewer who gave it 1 star angrily (albeit correctly) noted, it ""does not offer a native web browser to surf the internet...game over."" But another complaint I read that might be taken seriously (as it could actually be an issue in some instances) is that it only supports WiFi transmission up to 2.4 GHz. To be sure, if all things were equal, something like the Firestick (which also supports 5.0) might be the better choice, but since the Roku Express is currently $10 cheaper, and 2.4 is perfect for my needs, I'm personally happy with the Roku Express.

  It seem Roku is incapable of actually providing service to all of the new customers the pandemic brought them. First problem: you must create a Roku account to use the device, but their website isn't working, customer service is off duty until the pandemic is over, and their online community is full of people having the same problems we are: Fill in the Create An Account screen, hit continue, data disappears. Try 6 different versions of your name, etc. AND STILL WON'T ALLOW YOU TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT. Based on their community pages, hundreds, if not thousands, are having the same problem.There's also the issue of their date collection practices: basically, according to the policy you must consent to, they will collect every bit of data transmitted over your wife, including from all your devices - phone, computers, anything on wifi - and sort it, track it and sell it.Best choice when it comes to Roku: don't buy one. If you did, return it if you can. Watching TV isn't worth what Roku takes from you.

  So far, not bad for the price but the setup instructions were underwhelming.  From the TV screen, an activation code was sent to my  email.  Following instructions and on screen prompts, I inadvertently ended up ""creating an account"" which I did NOT want/need.  Next day found an email that says one does not need to creat an account.  WHHHAAT?  So information such as gender, age, DOB, credit card #, phone, address etc are now all in their system.  Maybe learning curve for me but....If you purchase this thing, be careful bc it was not clear about setting up streaming without the creation of an account.  Also was confusing/misleading in their promotion of ""free"" streaming  - but again, caveat emptor bc some of these seem to be during a ""trail"" period only.Miss Apple streaming.

  Bought to use with Xfinity ""Beta"" app.  This app is little awkward -  you can't switch channels by going Channel up or down, the interface (with 2.4 Ghz  ) is slow and unwieldy.Picture quality was OK, but definitely not better than the latest Comcast box.If you are buying this to replace an Xfinity Comcast box, consider the above and get the 5 Ghz Roku..OK, got that out of the way.  Some pointers I learned the hard way.1 - I was using a TP-Link AC1750 router.  The Roku had lots of connection trubs, clipping out and then just quitting.  Little did I know that TP-Link had/has documented problems with their 2.4 Mhz bands in their routers - for real.  5 Mhz are exceptionally good.2 - I had an old ""slow"" Linksys router (which was replaced by the TP-Link) laying around.  I connected to the TP-Link as an access point and now use the Linksys with the 2.4 to connect the Roku.  Way better, with almost no interruptions.  Comcast program listings are still a little slow to come up.  Consider 5 Mhz.3- Buy the Roku that has the 5 Ghz  interface.  Probably worth the price.  And the TP-Link won't have problems on the 5 Ghz.Currently Roku Ultra/Stick/Stick+ are only models with 5 Ghz.

  This controller uses IR, not wi-fi. So it takes control of my cable tv and makes it impossible to get cable tv. The only fix seems to be to disconnect the roku express every time I want to watch cable tv. Moreover, it pairs with my wi-fi Roku in another room, which now cannot be independently programmed. The lesson: get a wi-fi roku model, not the Roku express. It took me 33 days (today) to discover there is no fix, so it’s too late to return it to Amazon.  There should be a warning.

  So, when I first got this, I was really excited. The reasons I gave this 2 stars, though, is because one, you have to be able to point the remote at the little box, which I didn't know, and for me, the Netflix app on here didn't work. i tried everything. I played with the settings on both the Netflix app and the Roku, restarted the Roku, undownloaded and downloaded the app (multiple times), took to the internet. Nothing I tried helped, and it didn't really help that all the articles and videos I watched are from 2-4 years ago. Then, when I tried to return it, on the first day UPS didn't pick it up like they were supposed to. I waited another day until I contacted Amazon. The next day when I contacted them, before I did, UPS knocked and when I went answer the door 30 seconds later, they were gone. They came the next day. It took 3 days when I should have taken 1. Overall, I would recommend than instead getting this, get a Amazon Fire TV Stick. I returned this and today I just got the new one. I am excited for that, as I have the older version and it still works, it just is getting old (we have had it since it came out) and has started freezing a little bit (I am just realizing how long this was, sorry about that...).

  I just received this Roku player yesterday, and set aside some time to install and set it up today. I got it to more or less convert an older ""dumb"" TV into a ""smart"" TV for watching mostly Amazon Prime Video and Netflix in a bedroom. I didn't want to spend a lot of money, and didn't feel I would need anything advanced, so at the low price of about $25 I decided to give this a try.Aside from a bit of head-scratching trying to remember how to set a TV I hadn't used in years to display its HDMI inputs (not the Roku's fault), the installation and setup was quick and easy. I'd estimate that I spent a total of 30 minutes, which included the connection, signing the device into my wifi, the device updating itself, creating a free Roku account using the link supplied on the TV screen, and signing the device into my streaming services. I was also pleasantly surprised that I got some free channels from Roku. I didn't do it yet, but I may enable the feature that allows me to control the Roku with my iPhone.The player works like a charm and I couldn't be happier with it for the price. If you feel that you need your Roku remote to control your TV as well, you are going to have to bump up a couple of notches in price, but this simply was not a concern for me. If I had to make one very slight criticism of the product, it is that the small strip of double sided tape they supply for mounting the player wouldn't stick to anything for more than a minute or two. So I mounted my device using electrical tape, until I can get some better double sided tape.Be aware that there are some scam sites that will try to charge you an activation fee for your Roku. The instructions address this, and the problem can be avoided by using ONLY the link that appears on your TV setup screen from Roku for activation.

  I have a new-ish TV and a subscription to Netflix, but until I got this Roku I could only watch Netflix on my laptop. This Roku was very affordable and I'm happy with the results. The high-def picture quality is very good, and the remote is responsive and easy to use. Set-up was easy too.I have one major complaint, which is that Roku requires you to give them your credit card along with other personal information. It's part of the setup process and as far as I could tell there's no way to get to use it without setting up an account and giving them this info. I don't plan to buy any movies or subscriptions through Roku, just stream Netflix, so I don't expect them to ever charge my card. I hated going through all that registration and being forced to give the company that info. But I'm still giving it 4 stars because I've done some research and it's clear to me that there's no better option -- the alternatives from Google, Amazon, and Apple are as intrusive if not more; all things considered, this Roku is as simple, practical, and user-friendly as you'll get, so I recommend it.

  The Roku express had a difficulty just getting setup. I plugged it in, and the ROKU logo would bounce up and down. I had to unplug and replug the ROKU to get it working again. This happened again if I paused too long trying to activate the account. I got it to work for a little while, and things were fine, but within 2 days, I got the boot loop again, and nothing would fix it. I unplugged, waited 30 seconds and replugged. I changed the HDMI cable and the port. I checked the tv with other casting devices to ensure the tv wasn't broken.I'm getting a replacement on the chance that the ROKU I got was defective, but it's disappointing that I had problems with setup right out of the box, and then complete failure 2 days later.

  I only received this player yesterday so I haven't had time to really learn all the ins and outs and how to navigate my way around all the content, which is very impressive. I don't know what I expected, but I never realized just how much content there would be. With the exception of your local channels and some regional sports channels,  just about any channel or program and streaming service you might want to watch are here. If they aren't you can download the app for it. You also have the ability to watch free movies or rent them. First of all, everything you need to set up comes in the box. The player has a remote with batteries included, and an HDMI cable. You also have the option to either connect the power adapter or you can use the USB port on your TV if you have one. This eliminates more cords laying around. Set up is fast and easy. All you need is wireless internet and the player does all the work for you. It easily guides you through the set up process. It took maybe ten minutes to get through. The only complaint I have is the HDMI cable included is too short. I had to use a longer one I happened to have. It just isn't long enough to allow for the fact that different TVs have ports in different locations from one another. This is a minor problem, not really anything to keep you from buying this device. If you are sick of paying through the nose for cable or satellite and aren't concerned about missing your local channels and some sports channels then I highly recommend this player. You can play this along with your cable or satellite at the same time by just using the input button on your TV remote. If you want to have access to tons of content, this ROKU Express is a no-brainer. For the price you can't go wrong. I was somewhat suspect before I hooked it up but now I am very glad I made this decision. Buy one and start streaming.

  Don't get me wrong. For $24, this device can turn any TV into a smart TV. I had to make the switch to Roku because I recently switched to an Internet version of Cable TV and the app didn't work on my fire stick or old AppleTV. I bought the $50 version and the $24 to compare them. On the surface, these appeared to have very similar features, but this one lacks an RF remote which means it requires an IR receiver (included, but clunky). The remote also lacked controls for the TV (power, volume) which means you still need your TV remote. It also lacked the voice control, which I didn't think would be a big deal, but makes the user interface a bit more painful. The Wifi also seems to be not as strong as the 4k. All in all, the interface is the same, but I would go with the more expensive one to get a better remote, better connectivity, and better streaming (4k vs. HD).

As of this writing the 2.4ghz hotspot it did find works okay but I'm worried I may not get the great quality I'm expecting.  I'm going to monitor this for a couple of weeks and report back.  But as of now, it's running well and was pretty easy to set up.  Not sure if there is a way to hook a wireless keyboard up to it or not, but that would have made adding all my streaming media accounts so much easier.Well worth the price!!!

  Update:I would buy 100 amazon fire sticks before  I would buy Roku.I refuse to be bullied into putting one of my credit cards in the virtual hands of this no contact, no support no responsibility company.A billing error, or flagrant overcharge would never be corrected by a bot.I would be a first rate chump to give it my credit card.I object that Roku activation now requires a credit card, that ***cannot be removed***.There is no protection against accidental purchase, such as a code.Accidental purchases seem to be part of this company's model.Both Prime Video and Comcast require extra steps and permissions for purchases. Credit cards can easily be removed from both.Roku no longer has a contact phone number or personal chat for assistance.Support instructions to remove a credit card is inaccurate. There is no ""remove card"" option, as stated. There would be no way to stop an accidental purchase.I got this to stream Xfinity, in my basement. There were tornado warnings.

  I spent 6 hours over two days attempting installation on two different Toshiba TV's with my streaming device, including watching available videos and help info.  I never was able to get beyond the Roku logo on my screen with one TV and the other one showed a picture one quarter of the screen size.  After several attempts reinstalling, and unable to contact a live person at Roku for assistance, I finally returned the item to Amazon. I received an email on 5/9/20 from Amazon saying I had been given the credit but it's not showing on my statement.  Now, adding insult to injury, I've wasted an hour with 3 different Amazon Customer Service people, including a so-called Specialist who disconnected my call.  The only consolation is that I chose to sell my Roku stock right after this experience and made 177% profit from it at its 52-week high. I then ordered the Amazon Fire Stick which I easily installed in a few minutes!  Even though Amazon's current Customer Service via telephone is inadequate, I will give them credit for a much better product for those who want to cut their cable service.

  I’ve bought two of these in the past few months. Neither will stay connected to the Internet. I have a new router and high speed Internet.

  This streaming stick is highly rated on Amazon. We decided to try using it for TV streaming instead of paying for cable boxes. I have had nothing but trouble with it. I'm pretty tech savvy, and have run all the troubleshooting, adjusted my modem settings, etc, etc. It continually drops the connection to the WiFi. We have an extremely fast connection, and I've speed tested the connection with my computer at each location of a Roku. Even the Roku says the connection is excellent when it's connected. We don't have issues with any other WiFi connected device in the house. We originally selected the Roku because the Xfinity Stream app was not available for our Fire Sticks. Well, now, a month later, it is, and the Fire Stick seems to be working perfectly, so I have no other conclusion to draw than it is the Roku Express. We purchased 3 of them at one time, and all of them disconnect regularly, even the one 12 feet away from the modem. Even though this device is getting great review on Amazon, if you google the problem, you will find endless complaints about it dropping the connection. I wish I could return them and get my money back.

  Others have stated there is an activation fee. There isn't. You simply open the link they send you in the email. Make sure it's the right site and not some scam site that some seem to have come across by clicking the wrong link. It will ask for a credit card, most things do if there are things that may be rented or purchased. I didn't look to see if you had to do this or not because we use several streaming services so they would need it anyways. It does not charge you anything unless you buy something while using the roku. As to the issue of it only showing in a corner and not filling the screen. When you first set it up, it asks for screen resolution. 1080 was to big so I simply said pick another setting, it allowed me to pick 720 and it's fine. I think our tv is a 50 inch. I'm not sure of the issues that others encountered, except that they seem to be user end issues and not product issues. Roku can't be blamed for someone searching for a link and the user clicking on a scam website that was obviously set up to seem like the roku site. Just users need to beware and not fall for scams. Instead of searching type the link exactly as they tell you. Pay attention when you set it up so you pick the right settings. Don't be in a hurry to get to the home screen.  I don't know about the internet issues some seem to have. Not everyone will have the same experience. If you want headphones and voice control well you have to pay the extra money for them. This works for streaming. Its not meant to control all of your electronics. It does what is stated. It streams the most popular streaming services and that's it. I'm happy with it.

  I already had 3 firesticks for my other tvs and decided to try this on a 4th tv. Roku makes you give them all your personal info as well as credit card. Obviously they are trying to pull you into their ""sphere"" so they can keep soaking you. However, this remote took 2 hours to load the stations and then was too slow to load causing buffering issues--none of which I have with the firesticks. Shame on Roku for allowing such a weak product to have their name on it. It went right back and I ordered another firestick (which has Alexa built in anyway). It's a whole $11 more.

  I have this unit literally 10 feet from a modern, high speed router operating at both 2 and 5 GHz and a fiber optic connection to the internet. Wireless at my house screams for every device except for one; this Roku. I constantly get warnings about a slow connection. I'm at wit's end; I've gone into the 'secret' menu and disabled/enabled network ping. I've moved it up, down, around the room. Doesn't matter. Slow connection to the internet; yet every other device I test gets between 80-90 Mbps. So wishing I had purchased one with an Ethernet port.

  RETURNING ITEMS! Not HD with it's poor picture quality; basic, limited, & quite useless remote which makes multiple remotes necessary. You cannot power the TV on/off, control the volume, nor access options easily with this remote. Can't pause live TV through this device either. This technology performs as if it were manufactured in 1998, NOT 2018.I bought this device (2 actually) to save $ on my Xfinity cable bill. Per Xfinity customer service rep, I could use a Roku device to stream Xfinity in lieu of leasing their standard receivers for $10/mo + taxes each. The poor, pre-plasma/LED/HD picture quality on my 1080p HD TV, toggling between remotes, and jumping all over the place to get to 1 app is purely frustrating. I will continue to pay $20+ per month for my Xfinity receivers.

  I resisted buying a Roku because I had heard that their privacy policies were terrible. But they do allow you to shut off some of their data grabbing.This works fine for the Netflix and Amazon Prime streaming I do. They constant nag you to buy additional channels. And, they keep adding channels to the home screen that they hope will entice you. But you can delete them.I used their customer service once, during set up. I wanted to create an account without giving them a credit card. I had read that could be done.The agent who was helping me was very poorly informed. He just kept repeating that the card information could be removed after I had completed set up. (Uh huh...) I had to ask many times to speak to a supervisor. It took a good 45 minutes listening to incorrect information before I finally was connected. The supervisor quickly explained the simple steps to set up without a credit card.So, I would rate Roku as a company with less than honest business practices. But, I was able to (finally) use it without giving them my credit card info.

Purchased two Roku Express devices last week for my two TVs and WOW!--am very impressed with how fast everything now loads. I didn't have to use the HDMI cable that came with them for I just used the two I had already plugged into my old Rokus.  Set up was fast and easy for this senior lady and there was NO activation fee. Directions on the accompanying manual were simple with pictures showing how easy it all is to set up.

  I bought this as a gift for family member. Roku allows you to have access to all sorts of streaming services (PBS, NBC, HBO Max, Disney, Nat Geo, CBS, Showtime, and more) all from one starting point. Yers, you have to pay for most, but not all. While I don’t use the free ones as much, they are at least Ok and it is possible to use this device to watch a lot of TV at little or no cost. It is fairly easy to find your way around.I use Sling to access most of what I want and have a package that includes CNN and MSNBC, plus lots of kids stuff, FX and FXX. You can get Spanish language programming and package heavy on sports.Only issue is that if you plug headphones into the jack on the remote, you will go through batteries quickly.  If you are worried about losing the remote, or if you want more than one remote. Download the app to your phone. That will make it into a 2nd or 3rd remote.Setting it up is simple. Just connect it and follow prompts on the screen.

  This is the 3rd ROKU  I've purchased through Amazon and up until now I've been thoroughly pleased with the ease of setup and the operation of the device..  This Time, during setup, after I entered the code displayed on the screen an ""error"" message displayed I was told  NOT to request a new code but to call number shown to get new code and assistance with setting up ..... WELL big mistake!!! Do not get scammed like I did...  I was told that after June 3, 2020 ROKU is requiring all Users to signup for an annual plan for $149 or the Lifetime Plan for $199....  Well after 2 hours of back and forth..  my main objective was to set up my new Roku...  I fell for the Scam...  paying the $199...  immediately I received an Invoice and then was redirected to PayPal to pay the fee...  I tried to pay with my Credit Card knowing I had some protection if I was dissatisfied....  Well, that didn't work,  as they wanted you to pay with your Debit card....  Thankfully I was not successful getting the transaction to process with PayPal so the phony scammer processed the transaction with my credit card...  After completing the transaction I did not have a good feeling about the whole experience so I then went to the ROKU website and right away I read that ""ROKU does not charge fees for setup or use of the device,  if you have been charged fees YOU HAVE BEEN SCAMMED""!....  Long story I know but I immediately disputed the transaction on my credit card..  When I tried to contact the ""Customer Service"" number to cancel the ""Lifetime Membership"", which I was told I could at any time....  no answer..  or they blocked by cell number....  I setup new User ID's and passwords, cleared out the ROKU device to the Factory Settings and was able to go through the normal setup process without any issues.....  Thank You!

  For the Roku product line, you certainly can't beat the price. It's a minimum-frills device, perfect for the budget-conscious or persons needing a streamer for an older, smaller 720 or 1080 TV screen. (It does not deliver UHD.) One thing to note: it only connects to WiFi thru the 2.4GHz band. In my house, I have 2.4GHz and 5GHz dual band routers, and the networks have the same SSID/passwords on both bands. If attempting to control the Roku via their iOS app and my phone is connected to the 5GHz band, it can't ""see"" the Roku on the 2.4GHz band and gives a connection error. (What's odd is the individual channel control apps like YouTube, Netflix etc. all seem to find the Roku fine.) An internet search for this issue yielded a support page that advised this could be encountered.

  If you only care about watching movies and TV shows in 1080p, from well-known sources, this unit will work fine.  The devil is in the details.  While I was not looking for 4K or UHD capability, I failed to consider processing power.  A Roku box is a small computer!  And the Express apparently lacks sufficient power/resources to provide a pleasing experience in all respects.  However, it does provide clear, fully saturated, well color balanced video streams -- most video content looks good while streaming.  It also does a credible job of down-scaling higher resolution content.So, why only three stars?  First and foremost, I finally figured out that Roku is an open platform for amateur content providers, many of which have limited computer programming skills.  This may be a plus for some users, and this platform/community could become much stronger over time.  In early 2020, however, there are literaly 1000s of ""channels"" and no way to determine their quality except to sample them one-by-one.  My biggest frustration is in the area of ""screen savers"".  I bought this Roku Express to replace a 1st gen ChromeCast unit, which now provides stuttering audio on most YouTube clips.  I have been spoiled by the vast collection of Google images available to that unit's screen saver function.  I tend to leave my flat-screen TV on, with the steaming Screen Saver running for long periods of time.  I can no longer do that with a Roku Express because streaming Channels cannot be used as a Screen Saver!On any Roku box, Screen Savers can only be (initially) selected from Settings, not from your Home list (a series of Channels and Apps you have selected and loaded).  To make things more confusing, most Screen Savers are also Channels, which show up in your Home list after being loaded from the Settings list.  Some such Channels are not actually Screen Savers -- they cannot be assigned to the screen saver function, even though they appear in the Screen Saver list in Settings!  Also, some regular Channels (not listed in Settings) claim to be Screen Savers, but they too cannot be assigned to that function.  In fact, NO Channel that includes streaming video clips can be assigned to the screen saver function!  Some true Screen Savers, such as the Roku ""city walk"", virtual fireplaces, and virtual aquariums, are actually Apps that may or may not show up in your Home list.  They use computer graphics rather than video clips to provide a scene that ""evolves"" over time.Once you choose and load a Screen Saver (App or Channel), you must separately assign it to the screen saver function, assuming it actually exposes a menu item allowing that action.  If it is a slide-show type source, showing still images in a fixed loop or randomly presented, it will likely expose a menu item to Preview its screen saver function.  If it is also a Channel, it will probably expose a separate menu item to Go To that Channel.  If it additionally shows up in your Home list, you can navigate from Settings to Home and access the associated Channel from there.  In my experience, using a Roku Express 2019, these three option look similar but behave differently!  It seems as though memory management consequences depend on which path is taken.  When testing Screen Savers, I have decided to load one, assign it to the screen saver function if available, and cycle power to my Roku box, allowing it to re-boot.  Then I access the Channel from Home, if possible, for best results.  For example, one ""randomized"" slide-show type source I tested would loop only four images in Preview mode, show about 18 distinct images in an unpredictable order using Go To mode, and show over 50 distinct images before repeating, when the Channel was opened from Home.  In no case have I been able to get more than 70 distinct images over say 30 min of viewing, even though the Channel claims to have more than 1000 available images in its database.I have also experienced problems when streaming Channels, such as History and SciGo, when they break for commercials.  Sometimes they transition to and from ad clips properly, but most times they cause a Continue Watching prompt to appear, which requires me to press Ok on the Roku remote.  Less often, they kick me out to a Recently Watched menu and I have to navigate back to the Channel I was watching.  Would these results differ if I had a Roku Ultra box with more compute power and onboard memory?

  I wish I got a Roku years ago...however, I also wish I paid a little more for the one that has an option to turn off! This little bugger gets hot! and the only way to power it off is to unplug it (or put it on a switch like a powerstrip). I'm not sure why they would forego this standard option that comes with every piece of hardware I've ever bought but there is literally no ""off"" switch on the remote or even the device itself. I even searched Google to try and figure out how to turn it off and it turns out nope! you just leave it on all the time or unplug it! Great design, Roku! (Or great trick to get us to spend on the more expensive model--if only you would have advertised this lack-of-feature, I may have bought the more expensive one up front!)Anyway, that very large and annoying flaw aside, the interface and options within the device's capabilities are great! All the new apps are in there and Roku even provides a LOT of free streaming movies and channels iteself as well as suggesting apps that stream free or with ads and offers free trials on others. I recommend the interface 100% but spend the extra dough and get one that can power off!

  I added ROKU EXPRESS after buying the ROKU ULTRA streaming media player.  The smaller Express player is perfect for our master bedroom, where I don't watch as much and didn't feel l needed the somewhat bigger Ultra. Having said this, I think they give the same selection of channels to choose from - and the slightly lower maximum resolution is not an issue to begin with.I set the Express on top of the tall dresser that serves as our TV stand. It is barely visible, lying right underneath the TV. Reception via remote is fine from across the room. It works absolutely perfect and any problems that might arise with streaming actually come from our cable and Internet service provider and have nothing to do with the device itself.The TV picture is so much better than without this little box. I love the selection of channels and the ease of scrolling through everything I have put into my Home Page. The only improvement I can think of right now, is that I would prefer if the Express Roku remote also had a volume button.I like it both ROKUs so much, that I will definitely cancel our way too expensive cable subscription and rather pay for a few premium channels via ROKu instead.

After receiving the device I begin the setup only to learn that Roku REQUIRES credit card information from you to even make your account and use it. With all the recent data leaks going on online, I try to minimize how many places my card info gets stored when I actually use it, and they're requiring me to provide it before I can even use the roku to stream services I already pay for?

  I had a Roku from years ago that has worked just fine. However, recently, I wanted to view HBO Max. My old Roku device would not let me add HBO Max. I would simply get an error message. I have AT&T U-verse which gives me access to HBO Max from my PC, but my TV is not a smart TV. I read that a Roku device with version 9.3 software and higher is needed to access HBO Max. My old Roku is 9.1. I checked and that is the highest to which it will update. So, I bought this newer version and not only am I able to stream HBO Max, but all the channels are so much sharper. I almost ordered a different device other than another Roku after reading some of the reviews here. Apparently, some don't realize that you have to have an account that is associated with HBO Max to stream it. I definitely didn't want any device that listens to everything said. This one does not. You actually have to use the remote buttons. Oh, the horror. ;) The remote is super easy to use. This Roku sets up quickly and easily. It comes with an easy to follow quick start guide.

  This makes my 4th Roku device and with it I am now 99% free from cable TV - My internet service, of course, and the real irony is that in order to stream local channels I have to use an app from, you guessed it, the cable company. But I'm getting off the rails...This is my first ""wireless"" Roku. I have to say that a 5-10 minute setup procedure beats the living crap out of having to run ethernet cable 30 feet through the basement any day.This was literally Plug 'n Play and the Roku Express provides - right in the box - everything to get up and running. (I particularly like the strip of removable double-sided tape to mount the player to the side or top of the TV. Yes, I'm easily amused)Entering my new WiFi password turned out to be the most difficult part of the entire installation. Then having to log into all my streaming apps provided even more hilarity to the proceedings. Too bad it's not a standard to use a phone or other mobile device to verify the login is legit.Anyway, as rambling and wordy as it is, the point of this review is to say, ""Yes! I highly recommend this device""

  My roku works fine for streaming content for the most part, but as far as the functionality of certain other advertised features, it fails utterly. For instance, it does NOT work with google home. I have confirmed this through extensive internet research, with endless people complaining about the issue and asking for help, but not a single resolution, or response from roku that I could find. Mine says that it’s connected, but when you actually try a voice command, the google home just says it can’t communicate with the roku. Furthermore, I can’t troubleshoot this with roku because my particular product, although newly purchased, is ineligible for product support, just access to tons of unanswered FAQ’s in their community forum.There are also little issues, like if I try to set a screensaver other than the default options, it doesn’t work and defaults back to the roku logo. Also a heads up, it does not support 5G WiFi, which they don’t claim, but I didn’t realize this prior to purchasing. And lastly, my Apple TV app specifically glitches out every time I try to use it with my living room tv. I have to repeatedly try to play an episode, getting an error message each time, until it finally plays, which could take anywhere from one to fifteen minutes.Aside from those specific complaints, it does perform its basic streaming function, which is why I haven’t replaced it. It serves its purpose, but the false advertisement (“compatible with google assistant” is right on the box) and apparent unwillingness to address customer concerns regarding its failings is off putting to me, and I won’t be buying one again.

  It’s good for the price. Unfortunately, the picture seems to switch from HD on its own because it starts to slightly blur or not appear as focused and sharp. Then, on its own, it’ll switch back to HD pic. It’s not a constant thing but it is enough where you can’t sit through a movie or show without it happening. There is no volume button on the remote, so you still operate it off your own TV or soundbar, which I have. I’ve been having an issue where I’m having to restart it more often now. I never had the issue with my fire stick. It just seems to freeze often and constantly has a lack of internet connection on it. I’ve tried adjusting the position of the device also. It sits right by the WiFi box so it can’t be anymore convenient to obtain a signal. Then when I check the WiFi signal, it’s always at full percent and functions well. I’ll probably upgrade to another device. It took a couple of months for this to start happening. I have 3 of these devices in my home and this happens often yet they’re the only device to be running at the time? The ease of use is great. Very self explanatory and seems to jump from function to function with no issues.

  After looking at the many Roku devices offered and the hundreds of reviews, many negative, I was unsure how to proceed.  When Netflix told me my Sharp TV would no longer support streaming movies ( and its not that old a TV) I had to choose to either get a new smart tv or go to Roku.  So even though I found the reviews confusing and often contradictory I bought the Roku Express HD Streaming Media Player 2019 for about $22.00  I figured if it didn't work out my out of pocket costs were now.Let me say that this was the easiest install, set up and operation I have ever experienced with any electronic device.  My tv had 4 HDMI posts and USB port and I knew my passwords for Netflix and Amazon which I subscribe to, so the it took about 20 minutes to set up and have it working.  I am thrilled with the this small streaming device that allows me to get a few more years out of my tv and it only cost me $22.00!

  I bought this product and entered my code that came from the TV.  A message came that I would have to complete the order by calling a specific number.  I called and the person on the other end asked for $80.00 via my credit card telling me I would be able to use it on any TV in the home.  I was so frustrated that I hung up.  Then I noticed at the bottom of the page on the TV was a message that said, ""we will never ask for money to activate"".  So I looked up the number for Roku and told the person assisting me and he said that was a scam that is going around.  So please be beware.

  I wish I bought a Roku sooner. I was under the impression - as are a lot of people it seems - that you have to pay a subscription to use it. You do not. For less than $30, you not only get a lifetime pass to the Roku channel, which has several shows and movies you might not find on other services, but also one convenient place for everything you do subscribe for. It's a small device, and comes with an adhesive to stick on your television, so you don't even have to worry about finding space for it. Interface is easy, although they do try to sell you some services, so you probably want to hide all the services you don't use. (Does anyone know what a ""Sling"" is? Didn't think so. I'd take an HBO or Prime button over that on the remote.) Overall though, I'm going to get years of use out of this.

  Really easy to set up. Just plug it in to the tv via hdmi, plug into and outlit and that's it. Once you set it up with your wifi, just connect it to the streaming services that you subscribe to. I think all the bad reviews are people who assume you get everything for free, which you do not. Roku is just the thing that lets you stream subscription services onto your tv if you don't have a smart tv/video game console that already does this. You need to pay for the subscriptions separately, like netflix, hulu etc. I bought this for my grandma to use the subscriptions I already pay for and just added her to my account for her to be able to always watch her shows even when they're not on cable. Very good purchase, would recommend anyone to just get one. Very simple to navigate.

  Bought his to upgrade my old Roku Express which is 4 years old. It still works fine, but the UI navigation is kinda slow and clunky. This new one is much faster in the UI, but so far (after one day) it has rebooted itself after the video starts stuttering three times, and multiple times it has gone to buffering mode, then eventually resumes with very degraded video quality which never recovers until I reboot it. Can't really be my network because the old version in exactly the same spot works flawlessly. Returning this and staying with the old one!

  I bought this for the sole purpose of the guest mode. My mother has a private guest / AirBnB studio apt. on her property with all the trimmings. The guest feature is perfect for those travelers that are there for a few days.The only issue I have is that it uses infra red to communicate with the remote. There must always be an unobstructed line between the remote control and the base for communication to take place. The Fire TV Stick wins out into his because it uses Bluetooth technology I believe. This is the one feature I don’t like. You simply can’t hide it behind the TV like you can with a Fire Stick.User interface is easy to navigate. It’s much easier than the FIre TV stick to move around the screen. Stream quality is great as well. The price could be better. Wait for it to go on sale.

  I really love the roku but it seems to have so many glitches. For awhile we couldn't get any videos to play on YouTube. Then the ads on Hulu cut parts of the show out and you cant rewind to view them. (It doesnt do this on our tablets or phones, only roku).Now amazon prime TV wont open at all. I've restarted it, deleted channels, tried updates,etc etc. I still seem to keep having glitches. After a couple months the YouTube problem resolved, not sure how. But hulu and amazon prime apps are still having issues.

  I have 2 televisions in my RV so I decided to get both a Fire Stick 4K (which  I purchased for $30) and this Roku device for $22.  The Roku does the basics and is easy to setup, but the Fire Stick is superior in a few ways that are deal breakers for me.  First, I can use my Fire Stick for turning the tv on/off and volume control which I have not been able to figure out on the Roku.  Second, the Roku Private Listening mode requires the app to work and is not reliable.  There are many times I don't want to rely on the app to watch tv as I may not have my phone with me and it requires an extra step that becomes annoying at times.  But worse I found the Private Listening disconnected several times to the point where it was frustrating.  I will keep my Roku, and maybe consider a higher end Roku for my new 4K TV in my house, but overall, if you care about 4K, one-remote control and easy bluetooth connectivity, the extra money for the Fire Stick is well worth it.

  It is true, Roku requires a payment method when activating the device. I have been a Roku user for several years but had to replace an older model to get the newer stations.  I have never purchased from Roku and resent being forced to enter that personal information.  Within an hour of activating the new Roku, I began receiving spam emails that have been non-stop.  The sound has been cutting in and out since activation.  I will probably go through the hassle to  return.  Prior to this purchase, I was a Roku fan.

  We're a roku family. Always happy with the interface and streaming quality of the roku line of products.  Easy to set up and navigate. Even my not so tech savvy mom set hers up straight from the box.Love the search roku feature for specific movies/shows, makes it quick to find obscure movies without having to visit every channel.The app for your phone means you don't need a head phone equipped remote even for the more basic streaming devices.As internet upgrades happen we find the devices need to be replaced every 4 years or so. Each one has been smaller than the last. Now they come with an hdmi cord which is super convenient.I do wish the mounting tape was stronger, none of them stick to the bottom of the television lile they should.

  Got this for an older set that I have in my shop. I avoided the fancy 4K units because I didn't know if this set would even support them. This is a no frills unit that requires line of sight directionality for the remote to work. The kit comes with a section of double stick tape so that you can locate the sending unit anywhere on the TV. I mounted this one on the top of the set and it works fine.As I said, it's no frills. There's no volume control, power control, or voice recognition. That was not a problem for me because the one I replaced was set up the same way. Nothing new to learn, right?Overall, this is a good choice if you have an older set and don't need all the bells and whistles.

  Works extremely well and I love how compact it is. So far, I haven’t had any issues. I saw that some people in the reviews said that there was an activation fee. THERE IS NOT ONE. When setting it up, it asks you to go ahead and put in a credit card. However, it is not charging you for anything! They want your credit card number incase you would like to rent a movie or subscribe to a channel. That way your payment method is already on file. There is no activation fee. The only thing I have to complain about is that the color on it is a little off. The Roku makes the picture look brighter than what it is, but it’s not a big deal. The quality of the picture is still nice. The remote also doesn’t have an on and off button for the Roku, so you can’t ever turn it off unless you unplug it. The remote also doesn’t have a volume button so you would have to use two remotes. Overall, it’s a great device for $20. I think it’s worth it if you’re in a pinch.

  I have in my house three different (don't ask me why, all of them are presents to me) models - Roku, Amazon fire stick and Chromecast stick. The last one is the very worst one having a hard time to communicate with latest Samsung model. Amazon fire stick is good as well, but Roku to my personal experience is the best - easy to install, easy to work, and it is very reliable. What possibly else you can ask for - it is much worth for the price and for the service. I love it, therefore I got another one and Chromecast would sit in the box forever. Thank you Roku designers.

  You can't beat the price for what you get. I added this to a 15 year-old 720p TV. The interface matches the newer TVs that I have with Roku TV built in, which is exactly what I was looking for. I was able to return the cable box that this TV was using b/c my provider now has a great Roku app that includes access to my DVR. I no longer have a monthly charge for the cable box and have a much better featureset and user interface. This device will pay for itself within 6 months. What makes me happiest about this is the small sense of victory that I felt when I gave Xfinity the middle finger (in my head only) and canceled the monthly recurring charge for the antiquated box that had been my only option for so many years.

  We had an older (8-10 years old) streaming DVD player that we used to stream Prime and Netflix using a projector on a large screen.  It began to pause and shut down regularly, making us have to turn off the player and turn it on again, which would take about 2 minutes every time (multiple times during a 45 minute episode) and we thought maybe it was our internet service.  However, my iPad had no problem streaming.  My first thought was a more expensive streaming device, but we don't have a fancy 4k TV and don't care about 4k, so the more expensive versions seemed overkill.  This was really inexpensive, easy to use and worked immediately.  No more  pausing and restarting and it does everything we want it to do and has more features than we care to use. We are happy and the pausing problems are behind us.

  This is a great device to turn your standard TV into a smart TV. Setting up the device is quite easy. It comes with the Roku device, HDMI cable, outlet cord, and remote with batteries. It has a sticker to stick it to your tv, but it didn't stick too well on my tv. I had to use an alternative method. Velcro tape works well.  The user interface is pretty easy to navigate even if it appears a bit disorganized. There is a large library of apps including the usuals like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Disney +, and Youtube. The remote even have direct buttons for some of these often used services.  The phone app allows for some great features, like a digital remote which is great if you batteries run dead or you loose the small remote.

  We are seriously old school, so it took a while to work up the nerve to cut the cord with cable TV, but we're so glad we did! This little gizmo makes watching TV so easy, and saves us almost $200 a month in cable bills. My husband's main concern was being able to watch the local news, but he can still do that with Roku. There's all kinds of national and world news too. We already had Netflix and Amazon Prime anyway, and with the Roku, we added CBS All Access. We lucked out because pretty much every show we watch is on CBS, and for $9.99/month we can watch any show we want, any time we want, commercial-free. There are so many channels and options!

  MY INTERNET SUDDENLY STARTED BUFFERING SO MUCH IT MADE WATCHING TOO FRUSTRATING.  I had GOOGLE FIBER run check after check, REPLACE THE BOX, and was told I was below speed for such streaming demands (although I had been streaming at that speed for 10 years)  They insisted they weren't slowing things DOWN TO PUSH INTO UPGRADE and just started throwing out possible reasons.  One was the ethernet cable.  I upgraded and nothing changed so I thought it was either the ROKU, which had caused me issues almost from the start which resetting would fix temporarily, or an old ethernet cable.

  The Roku Express is easy enough to set up, but I immediately experienced network cabling errors which I determined to be a faulty HDMI cable. I received a discount and replaced the cable, which fixed this problem. I then had ongoing problems with low bandwidth and poor wifi connection, which I’ve never had with any other device. After trying numerous things, I moved the device on top of my TV rather than below it. This instantly resolved the problems. My wifi connection is now excellent and download rate increased 20 fold. If you have similar problems, try moving the device, especially if you have other electronics nearby. The reason I upgraded was to get a device that enables the Peacock app, which the Express does. The downside is that it only connects to 2.4G, not 5G, but so far it’s worked out okay.

  Our old Roku needed to be updated so we bought this one. It’s a little upsetting that you have to constantly buy Roku’s every couple years to keep up with all the new apps out there. You should be able to just update the one you have to accommodate the demands.It works as advertised and we now have access to the apps we wanted. The streaming quality is fair, not great, but it gets the job done. I do have to restart the Roku often as it will just go blank and stop working.Overall I’m glad I purchased it, but I probably won’t recommend it to anyone as they won’t want to deal with the issues I stated earlier.But for me, it’s worth it for the price.

  This is my third Roku, my other two are Roku sticks.  After reading all of the reviews, I was worried that I was going to be charged or asked to pay an activation fee.  This didn't happen for me during set up.  Maybe because I already have other Rokus.  I didn't have the app, so I followed the directions on the screen and downloaded the app.  I'm not sure I really need it.  You can use the app to make your phone a remote control.  Also, I decided to attach the small Roku device to the top of my tv.  As you can see in my last picture it is barely noticeable.  I was using an antenna on this TV and it was miserable to watch.

  Bought this to support Disney+ on our 2015 Samsung smart TV. It honestly didn't occur to me that it wouldn't work before we signed up for Disney+, so this was a much cheaper way to access it than buying a whole new TV. Overall, we all like the Roku and my 7 and 5yos can easily navigate the remote. The interface is clear and simple, and if you use multiple streaming services, they're all in there for you. If you're someone like me who reads all the private policy notices, be sure to allot a solid hour and a half for all that reading upon set up. One thing I haven't figured out yet is if there's a way to add things to the watchlist without actually having to click on it and go into it first. It would save time if you could do that just from the main menu. But overall, we like it. There were no sign up fees, I read other reviews stating there are.

  We bought this for our kitchen TV as a large cable box is not an option.  Previously, using a very small cable box, we could receive about 100 channels.  Navigation was easy.  We could turn on the TV with one remote and get the channel we were last at.  If we wanted to switch from channel 4, for example, to channel 68, we picked up the room and entered “68” and we were there.With Roku, turning on the TV now requires two remotes, not one.  And navigating simply to the news is 8 steps.  While we now get 1,000 channels, if we want to watch HBO through our Spectrum subscription, that requires 8 steps and scrolling through 500 channels.  And, for sure, there will be buffering issues.  And if you are watching the same show as someone in the next room, there can be a minute or so difference.Good, clear picture.The Roku remote can be quirky, sometimes not recognizing input.

  I didn't have TV for a year and I decided it was time for something, so I got a Roku.Warning: The first one I got was defective. After it connected to the internet, it went to a bouncing logo screen and stayed there....forever. Apparently this is a pretty common thing. (Knocking off a star because Roku customer support was not helpful at all.) Once I had tried everything I could think of, I chalked it up to a defective model and exchanged it. Writing this review in case the logo issue happens to anyone else. It is super annoying and seemingly un-fixable if you don't have a memory card in it (apparently if you do have a card in it, removing the card can fix the problem).All that said...the replacement works completely fine. It's easy and fairly quick to set up. I've only used it for Netflix so far but I've had no problems. For the price it's definitely worth it, especially if you're like me and don't need a ton of features.

  I don’t know what people are talking about regarding an “activation fee.” There is no fee. Bought this to replace an older fire stick that was not supporting newer apps. I am NOT a tech-savvy person. Install action was idiot-proof. Just add whatever services you want, enter your login info, and voila! Picture quality is great. I bought a mounting bracket for it (I think the remote has to be able to go straight to the Roku device) and it fits perfectly and sits right atop the TV. (My TV is about 6 years old, btw. I didn’t want to pay hundreds for a new smart TV. Glad I was able to get up and running with all the streaming I want for this $30 device.). Oh, and batteries for the remote are included.

  still one of the best streaming devices ive ever bought. Best bang for your buck. easy to set up works great and has everything i need for streaming basic services. The only negative and its not really that big of a deal is that if im standing too close to the IR sensor and not aiming directly at it the remote has a hard time making the connection at anything less than 6 feet. luckily ive learned lately that social distancing can make things so much better and by just stepping back a few more feet the problem is solved.

  I bought this to put on a third TV. I bought a ROKU TV and liked it so much I purchased a ROKU for another TV I had. I liked them both so much I purchased this one for my third. I enjoy the free stations that have a lot of older programs on that I enjoy. It's easy to use. My streaming is very good as well. I am hoping ROKU stays in business. I will purchase ROKU TV's from now on if they are available. Most of their add on devices are very good. I would always want to purchase their later models they are always improving.

  All of the apps I use on this device work great except for AT&T TV. There is a chronic lag between the audio and video when using this app. There is no fix for it, making the app and the service completely useless. This is a known problem and Roku is apparently in no hurry to fix it. (go read about it on the message boards)  They just keep pumping out the same defective device and pawning it on off on the public. I purchased this, thinking it would be an improvement over Amazon's disastrous Firestick problems. WRONG!!! I guess we'll just have to wait it out until someone comes out with a streaming device that actually works like it's supposed to!

  Haven't checked it out yet. But set up was a cinch for someone who is a tech dummy. Ok, I'm back after setting up my roku. Not a fan! It worked the first night. After that I couldn't get the movies on Prime and Netflix to load past 20 percent. Was on the phone to both parties thinking it was them. 2 days on the phone back and forth. It turns out that it's the Roku. If I disconnect everything and reconnect it works. I have to do this everytime I turn on TV. Roku doesn't have a person you can talk to. I had to figure this crap out for myself which in my opinion, it's not worth it. If I have to go through that everytime I want to watch TV, then it will be returned. Ridiculous!

  This Roku works very well and was easy to set up. YES, it DOES require you to put in a credit card for movie purchases. Also, I am majorly disappointed that remote had no power button or volume/mute buttons on the side like my Roku Ultra. Since I cancelled my mother’s cable, the cable remote no longer works to turn on the TV and we can’t find the original TV remote. SO at this time, the only way to turn on the TV or adjust the volume is to get up and find the teeny tiny (and I mean TINY) button on the back of her 72 inch TV. This is a MAJOR inconvenience. Now I have to buy a replacement remote for $19.99. Not happy about that!!! Just a heads up if you are purchasing this. Otherwise, it works great.

  This newer model has Spotify which I love as well as a button for the new Disney plus! It is better and quicker than the older versions . . . A very good deal!  Update . . . I feel like a dummy because I had a ROKU and the signal kept going out every 2 or 3 days so I bought a new ROKU believing it was the problem (Hey I am old school and am still learning tech stuff) the new one (this one) had the same problem so I investigated further and learned about ways to increase signal strength as I have a big 3 story home and my man cave is in my remodeled basement. Lo and behold the problem was NOT the ROKU! I love these things and highly recommend! Once I got a signal extender all was well! The low price is amazing and all that it does is unbelievable to one who grew up in the 3 channel rabbit ears TV era!! So you young people keep inventing stuff for us!!!

  We just recently said so long to DirecTV in favor of Hulu Live, which was no problem for the living room where a modern LG sits in all its glory, but the 2008 40"" in our bedroom needed a little help. This was a perfect solution. It has been an easy upgrade for the old TV, allowing us to stream content. The UI is simple and easy, as is the remote. There is a little setup involved that might challenge the technologically-challenged, but shouldn't be too hard.No, you don't have to pay anything to set it up. There is a Roku account set up, and you link a payment form to be used IF you want to purchase content from Romulus. Otherwise, no money required other than buying this awesome device!

  We've got 4 tv's in our house. Two upstairs and two downstairs. We got a Roku system for the two upstairs tv's and the downstairs tv in the kitchen when our cable system switched from analog to digital and we could no longer just plug a cable into the back of the tv. As we have a secure streaming network set up in our house, we simply streamed the cable box in the living room with the Roku systems. Because I found that there are so many streaming channels that I really like on the Roku tv's that weren't available via my cable box or my smart tv, I got a 4th Roku system for the living room tv in order to watch the Discovery+ or HBOMax channels in comfort. It was well worth the investment!

  This is a very easy to use streaming device. Streaming services can be loaded from the Roku app so you only see what you need (in my case Netflix/Prime video/YouTube) and avoid all unwanted apps usually seen on a smart TV. A great upgrade for a nonsmart TV or an outdated smart TV (I bought 3 already @24.00 each). The only inconvenience is the remote that only has Roku functions, no tv power/channel/volume/source. But there's a 14 dll programmable remote here on Amazon that adds exactly those buttons while keeping the Roku functions untouched. I don't care about picture quality HD 4K 8K and all that crap...

  I had my doubts about this product but I just connected and it works like a charm. I really don't need to stream other channels since I bought it for my daughter to watch PBS. She only likes that channel so far. There are other channels that are free that can be upload. The set up is tricky since it takes you to a payment screen. In order to avoid the payment I went back to main menu and set up with my computer. It's free!!

  I don’t know why anyone would bother trying anything else because ROKU makes a product that works well and works easily and simply right out of the box!  No complicated setup, etc. This is my third ROKU.  I have had the other 2 for several years.  I even take them with me when I travel.  Only problem with them is that I had to buy new remotes because I keep dropping them and the battery cover breaks.  This newer version has a lighter and smaller streaming box (not sure that matters much unless you want to glue it to a wall/TV).  The remote is also slimmer and lighter, but still works basically the same way.  One of my TVs is a smart TV, but since I use all 3, it is easier to have the same interface on all 3 for me.

  I set it all up, and then there was a bit of buffering when my toddler was trying to watch, I understand that though, it is streaming afterall. However later on the device was fast forwarding/skipping out of no where, the screen would sometimes go black and then come back. Not sure if it is the HDMI they sent me doing that? I have a firestick and ps4 that both have been used on that tv and I've never had an issue with picture or streaming. I'll be returning for a firestick. I was excited to try out Roku but, not for us.

  Excellent choice for cutting Cable out of my life because the Bill was no longer manageable anymore! Joining the Roku family is the best choice I ever made hands down plus there’s a plethora of movies, live shows, videos, sports, music, games, children stuff to adore, etc.!!! There’s so much entertainment one could be lost just exploring it all!! It’s a good lost though because there’s something for everyone to find and lots for free!!! I didn’t even know that the remote has voice control that’s another plus along with the good price! Choose what Roku streaming remote quickly because during my research for the best price the price went up after a couple days, but I was mad at myself for being to picky! I would definitely recommend to anyone, friends and family also of course!!

  I've had Roku in the past but wanted to get an up to date one to add a streaming service that my smart tv doesn't offer.  I may have been naïve about the claim that there is no activation fee, and while technically true it irritates me that I have to give them a credit card and every kind of personal identity information that any cyber thief could dream of.  If there is no activation fee, no credit card needs to be on file just to get the thing working.  Given that I feel misled, I will never make a purchase through Roku.

  I ordered this instead of the newer Roku stick because the room where we want to use it doesn't get wifi. The description of the product does not tell you that it only works on wifi and doesn't have an ethernet port. Even if we had wifi, the ethernet cable would be a much faster connection, so it is very disappointing that they don't disclose this important feature in the description. Can't use it.

  Finally broke down and put a tv in my bedroom. I needed something to use because it’s not a smart tv and I don’t want to run cable. This is perfect. Can watch Hulu and Netflix. Even has xfinity beta app which is what I most needed. Set up was easy. No issue at all. Even downloaded an app to my phone that makes my phone the remote. I can transfer the sound to my phone and use headphones at night as to not disturb anyone. Very good value for the price!

  About 10 days ago, my Roku failed to connect to internet after 2 years of use. I thought it broke and bought a new one from Amazon, the one I am rating. It too failed to connect. Yet my Roku Ultra and a Roku 3 work, all farther from the router. After checking the web, I found more than 100 other complaints. In all cases Roku sees the router, but does not accept the password. I have 4 bars from the router, but moved it closer to router to get 5 bars. Still no luck.  Router reset did not help. Please talk to Roku. Did they change software?  They have such a good product when it works.

  Our first Roku included a remote with voice activation, which we rarely use. This unit, at half the price, does basically the same thing and features all the same channels—why pay more? When our older smart TV no longer supported the MLB app, my husband went into panic mode. Roku to the rescue. This little unit took about 3 minutes to install, and works perfectly. Note: you can add multiple Roku units to the same account, and there is NO ACTIVATION FEE. (Apparently, some people are getting scammed by accidentally looking up a fake number on the web.)

  Purchased for a spare guest room tv so we didn’t have to pay a cable box rental for a room we rarely use. Works great. Yes the “speed” may be slower, but we don’t notice much of a difference from other tv’s with a higher up model of roku. It works better than the Blu-ray player we had with apps like Netflix and Hulu built in. Faster and more to offer. Saves us about $20/month on our cable bill if we needed to get another box, remote, and monthly connection fee. Roku has no set up or reoccurring monthly fees to use/activate it. You pick and choose what you want to subscribe to and log in on all your devices with the account.

  Every time, and I do mean every time, I switch to Roku, I get an HDMI error screen. I'm using all the supplied cables, but it has to be unplugged and plugged back in every stinking time. I go through the menu, pick the service, pick the program, and it isn't until the program loads that the error screen displays, telling me the HDMI is messing up. You get the audio, but only the error screen for video. I will have to return for a bigger unit. The 2 older ones have worked like champs for years, but the stick I got through Best Buy overheated every time (yes, I got the tiny extension HDMI cable), and now this Express has issues. It's old.Update: I had forgotten this last one was an express, and got another for a different room. Big surprise, it failed within 3 days. Won't connect to the internet. Back it goes.
